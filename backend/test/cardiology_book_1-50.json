      "left": "Alcohol and Coronary Artery Disease: Fact versus Fiction JPS Sawhney, Kushal Madan INTRODUCTION There has been a lot of controversy around the use of alcohol in coronary artery disease (CAD). Many studies are in favor of  wine  as  advantageous  as  compared  to  other  alcoholic beverages.  Some  studies  suggest  that  type  of  drink  was  not important.  Heavy  drinking  is  associated  with  increased mortality,  hypertension,  and  cerebrovascular  hemorrhage on the other end light-to-moderate consumption of alcohol is shown to be cardioprotective. How much drink is safe? In fact the definition of heavy, moderate and light drinking is not standardized. It must be known that definitions of a “standard drink” are variable by article and country thereby leading to imaginary facts rather than facts. The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  explore  the  link between  drinking  alcohol  and  CAD.  This  chapter  will  put forward  the  facts  associated  with  alcohol  consumption  and cardioprotective effects. So if someone does not drink already, is his heart a reason to start? UNDERSTANDING “STANDARD DRINK” A  standard  drink  (or  “unit  of  alcohol”  in  UK)  is  a  notional drink that contains a specified fixed amount of pure alcohol (ethanol).  Different  countries  define  standard  drinks differently.  That  means  one  standard  drink  always  contains the same amount of alcohol regardless of the container size or  the  type  of  alcoholic  beverage,  but  does  not  necessarily correspond to the typical serving size in the country in which it is served. For example, in the United States, a standard drink contains about 14 g of alcohol. The lowest number of grams of alcohol in Europe is in UK unit at 8 g and the highest in Austria at 20 g. In absolute terms, amounts of alcohol consumed less than  30  g  per  day  is  considered  as  light-moderate  drinking and alcohol consumed more than 30 g/day is considered as heavy drinking.",
      "right": "2CHAPTER ALCOHOL AND CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY Epidemiological  data  indicate  that  there  is  a  J-shaped curve  to  describe  dose-response  between  alcohol  intake and  mortality,  i.e.,  low-risk  in  light-to-moderate  drinkers as  compared  to  nondrinkers  and  highest  risk  among  heavy drinkers. In a meta-analysis of 34 studies Di Castelnuovo et al. concluded that low levels of alcohol intake (1–2 drinks/day for women and 2–4 drinks/day for men) provided maximum protection  (13–22%  in  women  and  15–19%  in  men).  On  the other  hand,  alcohol  intake  more  than  two  drinks  per  day in  women  and  more  than  three  drinks  per  day  in  men  are associated with increased mortality.2 Gaziano  et  al.  in  a  prospective  cohort  study,  studied 89,299 men (age 40–84 years) from Physicians Health study, who were followed over 5.5 years for mortality.3 They reported an L-shaped curve between light-to-moderate alcohol intake and  cardiovascular  (CV)  mortality  with  decreased  risk  at 1 drink/week. It was also observed that there was decrease in CV mortality as compared with nondrinker even at more than or equal to two drinks per day. Mukamal  et  al.  studied  245,000  US  adults  and  reported that  alcohol  intake  of  both  light  and  moderate  levels  was associated  with  lower  CV  mortality  compared  with  either heavy drinkers or nondrinkers.4 ALCOHOL AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Studies have reported that moderate consumption of alcohol is  cardioprotective.  Whether  this  cardioprotective  effect  is associated with lesser degree of coronary atherosclerosis was studied by Femia et al. in which association of alcohol with coronary  atherosclerosis  was  assessed  by  coronary  angiography  in  a  large  cohort  of  men  (1,676)  and  women  (465) from a coronary care unit.5 It was concluded that in a selected"

      "left": "high-risk  population,  moderate  alcohol  consumption  was independently associated with less coronary atherosclerosis and lower risk for cardiac mortality. This conclusion cannot be  extrapolated  to  the  general  population.  To  study  the association  between  alcohol  consumption  and  coronary athero sclerosis  in  asymptomatic  subjects,  study  was  performed on 1,795 individuals without coronary heart disease (CHD)  using  computerized  tomography  detected  coronary calcium. It was concluded that the risk of extensive coronary calcifi cation was 50% lower in individuals who consumed 1–2 alcoholic drinks per day than in nondrinkers.6 ALCOHOL AND CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICATIONS Cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  patients  are  mainly  taking lipid-lowering,  antiplatelets  or  oral  anticoagulant  drugs. In  such  setting  what  are  the  interactions  of  alcohol  and medications,  how  alcohol  is  metabolized  or  absorbed, whether alcohol affects the therapeutic effects of drugs, has not  been  sufficiently  investigated.  Moore  et  al.  studied  the risks of combined alcohol-medication use and reported that depending on type of medicine and amount of alcohol there could be aggravation of liver disease, dizziness, problems with coordination,  insomnia,  worsening  of  depression,  and  poor control of diabetes. Aspirin when combined with alcohol can raise the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.7 However,  more  research  is  needed  to  determine  the safety of alcohol consumption in combination with CV drugs. POSSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PROTECTION BY ALCOHOL It  is  hypothesized  that  moderate  alcohol  consumption reduces  the  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  through  its effects  on  high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDLc), insulin sensitivity, thrombotic activity, and inflammation. Effects on High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Moderate alcohol intake is associated with increase in serum HDLc. This increase in HDLc is also associated with increase in  apolipoproteins  (A-I  and  A-II)  which  are  the  major  HDL carrier proteins. According to Rimm et al. there will be 8 mg/ dL  increase  in  the  plasma  concentration  of  apolipoprotein A-I  and  a  16.8%  reduction  in  CHD  due  to  increased  HDLc from 30 g alcohol per day.8 Antioxidant Effects Alcohol intake may have antioxidant effect. There is a strong evidence  from  the  observational  studies  that  oxidation  of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is affected by the antioxidative effect  of  alcohol  and  thereby  impeding  the  atherosclerotic process. It has been shown that grape-derived beverages are rich in nutritional polyphenolic antioxidants and hence have cardioprotective effects.9,10",
      "right": "CHAPTER  2 Alcohol and Coronary Artery Disease: Fact versus Fiction Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity Alcohol  consumption is  also  associated  with  reduced insulin  resistance  and  increased  insulin  sensitivity.  This effect  is  probably  due  to  suppressed  fatty  acid  release  from adipose tissue and elevation of adiponectin levels during the Krebs  cycle  of  skeletal  muscles,  thereby  facilitating  glucose metabolism.11,12 Antithrombotic Effects Alcohol  promotes  reduction  in  blood  clotting  and  platelet aggregation, reduced levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)  activity,  fibrinogen,  plasma  viscosity,  von  Willebrand factor and factor VII, and increased concentrations of tissuetype plasminogen activator (tPA) have been described.13 (cid:36)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:16)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:192)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:40)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:86) Alcohol  may  confer  cardioprotection  by  acting  as  an anti-inflammatory  agent.  Recent  data  show  that  alcohol consumption suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-(cid:68),  interleukin-5, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP).14 DRINKING PATTERNS AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE Not  only  choice  of  beverage  but  also  the  drinking  pattern is  an  important  factor  of  interest  with  respect  to  CAD  and hypertension. Some of the studies mentioned in the report on moderate drinking from National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and  Alcoholism  assessed  the  differences  between  regular low  per-occasion  consumption  and  the  same  total  weekly consumption  all  at  once.15  In  fact,  the  pattern  of  alcohol drinking is not assessed by many studies, thereby making the comparison and conclusions difficult across the studies. To  assess  the  influence  of  drinking  pattern  and  type  of beverage (beer, red wine, white wine, and liquor) on risk of MI,  Mukamal  et  al.  studied  38,077  males  who  were  free  of CVD at baseline. There were 1,418 cases of MI during 12 years of follow-up once in every 4 years. As compared to men who consumed  alcohol  3–4  or  5–7  days  per  week  had  decreased risks of MI as compared to those who consumed alcohol less than  once  per  week.  Also  there  was  an  inverse  association between the risk of MI and four types of beverage, strongest for beer and liquor, intermediate for white wine, and weakest for red wine.16 The  most  favorable  drinking  pattern  is  regular  daily  or almost daily light drinking, with avoidance of clearly harmful binge drinking.17 INFLUENCE OF AGE AND SEX ON CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL Recent reviews suggest that alcohol consumption is mainly associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of  MI  among  men  over 45  years  of  age  and  women  over  55  years  of  age.  To  study whether  the  beneficial  effect  of  alcohol  is  influenced  by 9 age,  Hvidtfeldt  et  al.  conducted  a  pooled  analysis  of  eight"

      "left": "SECTION  1 Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factors prospective  studies  including  192,067  women  and  74,919 men and showed an inverse relationship for both men and women  for  three  age  groups  (≤50,  50–59,  ≥60  years).18  In a  population-based  study  of  4,410  adults  aged  more  than 65  years  free  of  CVD  at  baseline,  it  was  found  that  alcohol consumption was inversely associated with risk of CHD for men  and  women,  and  for  different  beverage  types.  Also  it was  concluded  that  moderate  consumption  (14  or  more drinks/week) was associated with lowest risk of CHD.19 It  has  been  reported  that  men  and  women  have  similar cardio protective  benefit  especially in  postmenopausal women. Nurse’s health study,20 studies from women’s health initiative21 and Swedish women’s lifestyle and health study22 have  demonstrated  an  inverse  relationship  between  moderate  alcohol  consumption  and  the  risk  of  CAD  and  total mortality in women. But it is evident from the literature that women  experience  toxic  effects  of  alcohol  at  approximately half the dose of men.23 Overall evidence from epidemiological data  indicates  that  alcohol  consumption  in  women  may  be associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  breast  cancer.  Relative effect  of  moderate  consumption  of  alcohol  is  lower  than the  increased  risk  of  acquiring  breast  cancer  especially  for women with a family history of breast cancer. Although there has  been  a  belief  that  alcohol  enhances  lactation  but  the scientific research does not support that alcohol consumption increases milk production but may actually decrease it. THE GENETICS OF ALCOHOL AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Alcohol  dehydrogenase  (ADH)  catalyzes  the  oxidation  of ethanol  to  acetaldehyde  which  is  highly  toxic  affecting  the myocardial  structure  and  function.  Any  genetic  variation  in the activity of ADH enzyme can lead to excess acetal dehyde accumulation.  Similarly  cytochrome  P450  2E1  (CYP2E1),  is another  enzyme  which  promotes  conversion  of  ethanol  to acetaldehyde. Chen  et  al.  identified  a  mitochondrial  protein  aldehyde dehydrogenase-2  (ALDH2)  which  plays  an  important  role in  alcohol  metabolism.24  ALDH2  activation  is  required  for cardioprotection as it catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde to a lesser toxic acetate. Therefore, it is the balance between the levels of ADH, CYP2E1, and ALDH activity that determines how much alcohol can be metabolized by liver, what are the byproducts and the underlying alcohol induced tissue injury including CVD. The French Paradox This term French paradox was first used in 1992 to describe the  irony  of  the  fact  that  in  spite  of  high  saturated  fats  in the  diet,  incidence  of  coronary  events  was  less  in  French population.  This  was  attributed  to  the  fact  that  there  was moderate  consumption  of  red  wine  along  with  the  meal.25 Epidemiological studies indicate that the amount of alcohol consumed in France, i.e., 20–30 g/day can reduce risk of CHD 10 by at least 40%.",
      "right": "Regular,  moderate  consumption  of  red  wine  has  been associated  with  reduced  CHD  and  mortality.  Red  wine  has higher levels of polyphenols (flavonoids and nonflavonoids, which  have  antioxidant,  antiendothelin-1,  and  antiplatelet effects)  as  compared  with  either  forms  of  alcohol.  But  the cardioprotective effects are due to ethanol itself rather than a specific type of alcoholic beverage (wine, beer, and liquor). A differential cardioprotective effect of wine could be because wine is always consumed in moderation as compared to beer or liquor. Studies have shown equal protection from all types of  alcohol  suggesting  that  the  specific  alcoholic  beverage  is less  important  than  the  quantity  and  pattern  of  the  alcohol intake.26,27 Two  components  to  understand  the  pattern  of  drinking are frequency and binge drinking. Mukamal et al. in a cohort study of 1,935 MI patients followed up for 3.8 years showed that  binge  drinkers  (even  light  binge  drinkers)  had  2-fold high-risk of mortality than drinkers who did not binge.28 There is  also  an  indication  from  the  literature  that  more  frequent drinking  (several  days/week  or  daily)  is  more  beneficial  as compared to occasional drinking.29,30 Frequent drinking may also  explain  the  so  called  “French  Paradox.”  French  people relate  the  beneficial  effects  of  red  wine  to  the  frequency  of drinking, i.e., every day with their meals. POINTS TO CONSIDER FROM THE PAST STUDIES (cid:120)(cid:3) There  have  been  no  reported  randomized  controlled trials  of  alcohol  consumption  and  CAD  outcome  data. This could be due to obvious ethical and logistical reasons (cid:120)(cid:3) Errors in the past: Shaper et al. in 1988 hypo thesized the presence  of  systemic  misclassification  errors  in  the  past studies associated with alcohol consumption and CHD.31 According  to  Shaper  et  al.  people  decrease  their  alcohol consumption  as  they  get  older.  Heavy  drinkers  tend  to recue  alcohol  intake  that  have  ischemic  heart  disease or  high  blood  pressure.  Inclusion  of  such  population  as abstainers might create bias which was not considered in past.  Shaper’s  hypothesis  was  not  further  evaluated,  but Fillmore et al. confirmed this and suggested that the cardiac protection  by  alcohol  may  have  been  overestimated.32 They classified the misclassification errors: (cid:3)(cid:99) Former drinker misclassification error, i.e., failure to eparate former drinkers from complete nondrinkers (cid:3)(cid:99) Occasional drinker misclassification error, i.e., failure to  separate  occasional  drinkers  from  complete  nondrinkers. In  their  meta-analysis,  they  concluded  that  the  few studies without this error (i.e., those that did not contaminate the  abstainer  category  with  occasional  or  former  drinkers) show abstainers and ‘‘light’’ or ‘‘moderate’’ drinkers to be at equal risk for all-cause and CHD mortality.33 (cid:120)(cid:3) As compared to heavy drinkers, moderate drinkers have a healthy lifestyle. It is presumed that heavy drinkers are likely  to  consume  more  tobacco,  unhealthy  diet  and  do less  exercise  and  this  unhealthy  lifestyle  could  be  the explanation for higher CV mortality in heavy drinkers"

ALCOHOL AND INDIAN POPULATION There has been ample evidence from the literature to show that  there  exists  a  J-  or  U-shaped  relation  between  alcohol consumption  and  CHD.  That  means  CHD  and  mortality rates  are  lowest  in  light-to-moderate  drinkers  and  highest among  abstainers  and  heavy  drinkers.  However,  there  is paucity of data from India to support this concept. Limited data in Indians from the INTERHEART study, a case–control study  of  patients  with  incident  acute  MI,  revealed  that in  South  Asians  alcohol  consumption  was  not  protective against  CHD.34  The  odds  ratio  (OR)  of  having  MI  was  1.64 [95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  1.21–2.27]  among  Indian alcohol users as compared to nonusers. Roy et al. conducted a surveillance study in ten industries across India to assess the  CHD  prevalence  among  4,465  male  subjects  who  were present  or  past  alcohol  users  as  compared  to  abstainers.35 Consistent  to  INTERHEART  study  they  did  not  observe any  protective  association  between  alcohol  intake  and the  prevalence  of  CHD,  rather  suggested  a  possible  harm of  alcohol  for  coronary  risk  in  Indian  men,  since  there was  significantly  higher  systolic  blood  pressure,  diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar in alcohol users as compared  to  lifetime  abstainers.  The  contradictory  results could  be  due  to  differences  in  ethnicity,  type  of  alcoholic beverage, and pattern of alcohol intake. The beneficial effect of  moderate  alcohol  consumption  is  not  a  global  finding because  most  of  the  research  reported  in  literature  is  from western  world  where  the  climate,  culture,  and  diet  are  so different from Asian countries. Similar to Indian population, it  is  reported  that  moderate  alcohol  does  not  confer cardioprotective  effect  on  ischemic  heart  disease  mortality among older Chinese population in Hong Kong.36 DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL INTAKE Alcohol  abuse,  binge  drinking  has  all  been  associated  with harmful effects such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, hyper triglyceridemia, stroke, injuries, and accidents.37 Corrao et al., in a meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and the risk of neoplasms and non-neoplastic disease, reported strong trends in risk for cancers of oral cavity, esophagus, and larynx.38 Ethanol at higher doses is associated with cardiotoxicity thereby  developing  alcoholic  cardiomyopathy  and  heart failure.39 Excessive alcohol uses can also precipitate cardiac arrhythmias typically atrial fibrillation.40 A WORD OF CAUTION Alcohol is classified as a human carcinogen (class 1) by the International  Agency  for  Research  on  Cancer,  with  a  doserelated  increase  in  prevalence  of  several  cancers  either",
      "right": "CHAPTER  2 Alcohol and Coronary Artery Disease: Fact versus Fiction exponentially  (e.g.,  oral  cavity  and  pharyngeal  cancers)  or linearly (e.g., esophageal and breast cancer), beginning at the level of the first to second drink per day. Keeping  this  fact  in  mind  it  seems  cardioprotective benefits are relatively less than increasing the risk of cancer. The  term  “moderate  drinking”  is  inappropriately  used and  should  be  avoided  in  scientific  literature.  Public  health advocates suggest “nonharmful” or “drinking at low-risk” are more useful terms. Complete abstinence is easier than perfect moderation. —St. Augustine CONCLUSION Present  available  literature  about  the  beneficial  effects  of alcohol  is  substantial  and  contradictory,  so  it  is  less  likely to  make  a  straightforward  recommendation  regarding  the optimal limit of consumption of alcohol. Caution in making general recommendations is needed. Based  on  the  epidemiological  and  clinical  evidence,  as compared  to  nondrinkers,  “moderate  alcohol  use”  should not be interpreted  as “healthy alcohol use” (Masters, 2003). However, it is not suggested to initiate drinking if you do not  already  because  alcohol  certainly  has  well-established neurotoxic,  hepatotoxic,  and  carcinogenic  risks.  There  are safer and healthier ways to protect your heart. Thus,  we  encourage  people  to  discuss  alcohol  use  with the  physician  and  make  an  individualized  decision  about appropriate consumption. REFERENCES 1.

      "left": "Vitamin D and Cardiovascular Disease: Indian Perspective Ramu Adela, Rajesh Khadgawat INTRODUCTION Vitamin D Vitamin D, a secosteroid (steroid with open or broken ring), is  fat-soluble  vitamin  involved  in  maintenance  of  calcium metabolism  as  well  as  musculoskeletal  health.  It  exists  in two forms, ergocalciferol (D2, from plant origin) and cholecalciferol  (D3,  from  animal  origin).  With  limited  sources  in diet except for seafood, main source of vitamin D in humans is  synthesis  from  cholesterol  in  epidermis  by  exposure to  the  UV  radiation  (sunlight).  Exposure  to  sunlight  for sufficient  duration  bring  out  chemical  change  in  structure by  opening  a  double  bond  which  further  initiates  series  of structural  changes  resulting  in  formation  of  cholecalciferol (also  known  as  “Calciol”).  Once  formed,  cholecalciferol, an  inactive  form,  undergoes  hydroxylation  in  liver  and converted  to  25-hydroxycholecalciferol  [(25(OH)D)  also known  as  “Calcidiol”  or  “Calcifediol”]  which  is  further, hydroxylated  in  kidney  to  form  active  form  of  vitamin  D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol  [(1,25(OH)2D)  also  known  as “Calcidiol”].  Vitamin  D  receptors  (VDRs)  are  intracellular receptors  and  found  in  all  tissues  of  the  body,  including vascular  smooth  muscle,  endothelium,  and  myocardium. The  active  metabolite  1,25(OH)2D  binds  with  the  vitamin D  receptor  in  cytoplasm  in  the  targeted  cell  and  form  a heterodimeric  complex  (VDR-RXR)  with  retinoid  receptor (RXR).  Further  VDR-RXR  complex translocate to the nucleus  where  it  binds  with  vitamin  D  responsive  element (VDRE) in the DNA and exert its biological function through transcriptional regulation of targeted genes in targeted cells (Fig. 1).1 ASSESSMENT OF VITAMIN D NUTRITIONAL STATUS Nutritional  status  of  vitamin  D  is  assessed  by  measuring serum  levels  of  25-hydroxyvitamin  D.  Although  measurement  of  1,25(OH)2D,  active  form  is  also  possible  but",
      "right": "3CHAPTER measurement  is  cumbersome  and  at  the  same,  not  useful in providing nutritional status of vitamin D. One of the most debatable issues about vitamin D is cutoff used for defining vitamin  D  deficiency  (VDD).  Many  societies  suggest  serum vitamin  D  levels  between  12  and  20  ng/mL  to  define  VDD; however,  most  widely  used  cutoff,  all  over  the  world  is  less than  20  ng/mL  while  levels  between  20  and  30  ng/mL  are considered as insufficient and levels more than 30 ng/mL is used to define vitamin D sufficiency. Further, levels of VDD (<20  ng/mL)  are  divided  into  severe  (<5  ng/mL),  moderate (5  ≤10),  and  mild  VDD  (10  ≤20  ng/mL).2  These  cutoffs  are based  on  the  physiological  fact  of  occurrence  of  secondary hyperparathyroidism with decrease in vitamin D levels. VITAMIN D NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN THE WORLD AND IN INDIA High  prevalence  of  VDD  has  been  recognized  very  early  at the  start  in  19th  century  (1920s)  especially  in  causing  rickets, which  led  to  initiation  of  food  fortification  programs  in most  of  the  developed  countries.3  Over  the  years,  vitamin  D food  fortification  has  resulted  in  improvement  in  vitamin  D status  of  general  population.  However,  errors  in  fortification (fortification  of  large  amount  of  vitamin  D  by  mistake)  had raised  concerns  about  these  fortifications,  which  resulted  in many  countries  converting  universal  fortification  to  optional fortification  with  vitamin  D.  Vitamin  D  food  fortification program could not be started with wider success in our country. In spite of food fortification, high prevalence of VDD has been  reported  all  over  the  world,  across  all  age  groups  and both sexes.4,5 VDD is considered to be pandemic with report of  widespread  deficiency  coming  from  every  part  of  the world with maximum prevalence reported from Middle East and South Asian countries in spite of availability of sunlight throughout the year. Prevalence of VDD has been estimated to be approximately 30–60% in the general population.6 In  spite  of  geographical  location  of  India  (located  at  28° 36.8'  N  and  77°  12.5'  E  in  the  northern  hemisphere  of  the"

Contrary to  this  assumption,  high  prevalence  of  VDD  has  been reported throughout the country for all age groups including neonates, infants, school going children, adolescents, adults, pregnancy,  lactating  women,  and  senior  citizens.  This  is probably a result of poor sun exposure, dark skin complexion, atmospheric  pollution,  vegetarian  foods  habits,  absence  of food fortification with vitamin D, and poor intake of vitamin D supplements.7 The most of the published studies on vitamin D status of general population report that very high prevalence to the extent of 70–95% using a cutoff of less than 20 ng/mL. VITAMIN D AND NONSKELETAL EFFECTS One  of  the  major  functions  of  vitamin  D  is  maintenance  of musculoskeletal health. However, over the years, association studies  of  levels  of  serum  vitamin  D  with  many  chronic diseases  has  given  a  newer  concept  of  role  of  vitamin  D  in nonskeletal diseases especially, noncommunicable diseases. Vitamin  D  has  been  reported  to  influence  not  only  insulin sensitivity or resistance but also insulin secretion.8 There are several  studies,  including  data  from  the  Framingham  Heart Study,9 demonstrating an inverse association between insulin resistance and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. 14",

In a random sample of 6,784 subjects in the age group of 30–60 years, high serum levels of vitamin D was reported to be associated with lower incidence of metabolic syndrome and lipid profile favorable to CV health; however, no  association  between  vitamin  D  level  and  blood  pressure was  found.11  In  one  of  the  largest  study,  population-based sample  of  16,603  men  and  women  aged  18  years  or  older (Third  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey, 1988–1994).  Subjects  with  CVD  had  a  greater  frequency  of 25(OH)D  deficiency  (<20  ng/mL)  than  those  without  VDD. Even after adjustment of all CV risk factors, subjects with VDD had an increased risk of prevalent CVD with odds ratio 1.20.12 Another large study of 18,225 US men (Health Professionals Follow-Up  Study),  low  vitamin  D  status  was  found  to  be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) as compared to subjects with vitamin D sufficiency.13 Another data base study of 41,504 subjects, VDD was associated with highly  significant  (p  <0.0001)  increases  in  the  prevalence of  diabetes,  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  and  peripheral"

Serum  vitamin  D  levels  were  also  found to  be  significantly  associated  with  coronary  artery  disease (CAD),  MI,  heart  failure  (HF),  and  stroke.  Even  in  subjects without  risk  factors  but  with  severe  deficiency,  also  had increased  likelihood  of  developing  diabetes,  hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.14 In a recently published meta-analysis of 19 prospective studies with 66,000 participants, a linear and inverse association was found between circulating vitamin D level and risk of CVD.15 Similarly, VDD has also been reported to  be  associated  with  subclinical  markers  of  atherosclerosis like  intima-media  thickness  (IMT),  arterial  stiffness,  and coronary calcification. MECHANISM OF VITAMIN D AND PROPOSED CARDIOPROTECTION The  exact  mechanism  of  role  of  vitamin  D  in  proposed cardioprotection  has  not  been  elucidated  well.  The  most  of the information is coming from individual studies assessing effect  of  vitamin  D  on  cellular,  molecular,  and  biochemical parameters  associated  with  CVD.  Vitamin  D  has  shown to  inhibit  proliferation  of  vascular  smooth  muscle  cells and  increases  calcification  of  smooth  muscle  cells.16  It  has also  been  shown  to  regulate  the  growth  and  proliferation of  smooth  muscle  cells  and  cardiomyocytes.  It  has  been reported  to  inhibit  renin–angiotensin–aldosterone  system (RAAS) and inhibit the endothelial dysfunction, the initiation step of plaque formation.17 Similarly, vitamin D has also been found  to  be  affecting  the  immune  balance  by  suppressing proinflammatory and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and  chemokines  and inhibits  endothelial  dysfunction, leukocyte  proliferation,  cytokine  release,  and  platelet aggregation  the  process  involved  in  the  atherosclerosis",

In the same study, lower vitamin D levels were also found to be associated with  hypertension  disorders  in  pregnancy  and  circulatory cytokine  and  chemokine  levels.24  Cross-sectional  studies have  also  reported  higher  prevalence  of  VDD  in  subjects with CAD patients and found to be independent predictor of CAD.25-27 Multiple studies have also reported high prevalence VDD  in  patients  admitted  with  MI  patients.28-30  Similarly, higher prevalence of VDD has also been reported in patients with  ischemic  stroke  and  is  independent  predictor  of ischemic stroke.31 Higher prevalence of VDD in patients with dilated  cardiomyopathy  has  been  reported  and  found  to  be correlated with cardiac function.32 15"

Participants  were  allocated to  1-year  of  vitamin  D  supplementation  (4,000  IU/daily)  or placebo. The study showed improvement in cardiac function like  LV  ejection  fraction  and  reversal  of  LV  remodeling  like LV  end-diastolic  diameter  and  LV  end-systolic  diameter.37 Dalbeni  et  al.  conducted  a  randomized  double–blind placebo-controlled  study  on  CHF  patients,  high-dose 800,000  IU  (4,000  IU/daily)  of  cholecalciferol  for  6  months. The study revealed that 25(OH)D levels and ejection fraction were  increased  and  systolic  blood  pressure  decreased  after 6  months  treatment.38  Similarly,  another  research  group reported  that  vitamin  D  supplementation  (100,000  IU)  in subjects with baseline vitamin D insufficiency did not improve CVD  risk  factors  profile.39  Tomson  et  al.  reported  data  of vitamin D supplementation in BEST-D (Biochemical Efficacy and  Safety  Trial  of  vitamin  D)  double-blind  randomized placebo-controlled trial (4,000 IU/day for 12 months) did not show any improvement on blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and  cardiac  function.40  Another  recently  conducted  singlecenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with  vitamin  D  dosage  of  2,800  IU  per  day  did  not  show any  favorable  effect  on  lipid  metabolism.41  Chowdhury et  al.  conducted  a  meta-analysis  with  observational  and interventional  studies  and  concluded  that  in  observational studies,  serum  25(OH)D  level  was  negatively  associated with death due to CVD, cancer, and other causes; however, supplementation  studies  did  not  support  role  of  vitamin  D supplementation in improving clinical outcomes.42 Recently, published  systematic  review  with  meta-analysis  by  using placebo-controlled  randomized  trials  of  at  least  4  weeks  of vitamin  D  supplementation,  did  not  show  any  significant effect  of  vitamin  D  supplementation  on  CV  function,  i.e., flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity.43 Although, it would be difficult to compare results",
      "right": "CHAPTER  3 Vitamin D and Cardiovascular  Disease: Indian Perspective of  these  studies  because  of  many  limitations  like  lack  of randomization,  placebo-controlled  design,  use  of  hospital admitted  population,  small  sample  size,  shorter  duration of  intervention,  and  absence  of  VDD  in  study  subjects  at baseline, but still most of the studies have not reported any significant positive impact on outcome parameters. Multiple meta-analyses  published  assessing  effects  of  vitamin  D supplementation in various CADs, suggest no beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation in established CAD. However, pooling of results of all intervention studies would be not very logistic as design, duration, and dose of supplementation of vitamin D is highly heterogeneous. INDIAN STUDIES The  most  of  the  studies  published  from  India  are  of  observational  design  with  only  three  interventional  studies  have been  conducted  so  far.  Details  of  these  studies  are  given  in table 2. Abid  et  al.44  randomized  72  subjects  with  HF  (NYHA class II or more) with vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL into two groups, group I, subjects received cholecalciferol 60,000 IU  weekly  for  12  weeks  while  in  group  II,  subjects  received optimized  medical  therapy  but  not  vitamin  D.  Although, there  was  a  significant  improvement  in  echocardiographic parameters,  but  the  extent  of  change  from  baseline  did  not differ significantly between the two groups. Narasimhan et al.45 in an open label randomized controlled  design,  supplemented  a  single  dose  of  600,000  IU  of cholecalciferol  intramuscular  injection  in  patients  with ischemic  stroke,  and  compared  with  patients  who  did  not receive  vitamin  D.  Using  Scandinavian  Stroke  Scale  (SSS) as  outcome  parameter,  it  was  found  that  vitamin  D  supplemented  group  had  significantly  higher  SSS  than  patient who  did  not  receive.  Even  in  supplemented  group,  higher scores  were  seen  in  subjects  who  had  VDD  at  the  time  of screening in comparison to subjects who did not have. The sample  size  was  small  (30  in  each  group)  and  not  double blind  design  but  requires  further  exploration  of  results  in larger studies. Another  recently  published  randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled  study,46  effect  of  cholecalciferol  supplementation on vascular function was assessed in 120 patients aged  18–70  years,  with  nondiabetic  chronic  kidney  disease (CKD) stage 3–4 and VDD (≤20 ng/mL). Intervention  group  received  two  oral  doses  of  cholecalciferol  (300,000  IU)  at  baseline  and  8  weeks,  compa red with  matching  placebo.  In  comparison  to  placebo  group, chole calciferol  supplementation  significantly increased endothelium-dependent  brachial  artery  flow-mediated dilation at 16 weeks. Intervention also led to significant favorable  changes  in  pulse  wave  velocity  and  circulating  interleukin (IL)-6 levels. However, another interventional study, i.e., Indian Polypill study [The International Polycap Study 3 (TIPS-3)] which was  initiated  to  study  vitamin  D  suppleme nta tion  effect  on reducing major adverse CV events (ClinicalTrials.gov Identi17 fier NCT01646437), is still ongoing."

      "left": "Hormone Replacement Therapy and Cardiovascular Diseases Geetha Subramanian, Aviraj Choudhary, Kamaldeep Bansal INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  is  one  of  the  leading  causes of  death  in  women  globally.  In  industrialized  countries  like UK,  Northern  Europe,  and  North  America  coronary  heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in women, whereas  stroke  is  more  common  in  Southern  Europe.  As cardiac  events  are  very  uncommon  in  premenopausal females  which  in  itself  shed  the  light  over  the  protective influence of ovarian sex hormones inherent to menstruation cycle.  After  menopause  however  this  protective  influence begins  to  decrease  and  the  risk  for  CVD  tend  to  increase gradually equating itself to the male risk in eighths decade of life.1,2 The  estrogen  deficiency  that  ensues  after  menopause is considered the main culprit in increasing the risk of CVD. Estrogen  deficiency  exerts  its  metabolic,  hemodynamic, and vascular effects which influence the cardiac risk factors directly  or  indirectly.  In  some  observational  studies  it  has been shown that the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women had a lower rate of CVD and cardiac death  than  those  not  receiving  HRT.  However,  randomized studies,  Heart  and  Estrogen/progestin  Replacement  Study (HERS)  and  Women’s  Health  Initiative  (WHI)  showed  that HRT  may  actually  increase  the  risk  and  events  of  CVD  in postmenopausal women. MENOPAUSE-INDUCED CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS Adverse  changes  in  lipids  and  lipoproteins  and  in  glucose and insulin metabolism accompany the onset of the menopause3,4 encouraging the development of atheroma. There is also negative impact on vascular function, which results from the  loss  of  ovarian  hormones.  As  the  female  sex  hormone concentration  declines,  there  is  a  significant  increase  in the  level  of  total  cholesterol,  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides whereas the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol shows a declining trend. Indirect effects are also seen in alterations of blood pressure, obesity,",

In  1976,  the  Framingham  investigators  reported  a  2.6-fold higher  incidence  of  cardiovascular  events  in  age-matched postmenopausal  women  compared  with  premenopausal women.5  Surgical  menopause  was  associated  with  2.7-fold higher  risk  of  CHD  compared  with  premenopausal  women of  the  same  age,  and  women  with  a  natural  menopause had  2.2-fold  higher  risk  of  CHD  compared  with  premenopausal  women  of  the  same  age.5  Estrogen-deficient  state  in postmenopausal  women  can  account  for  changes  in  the cardio vascular function. Menopause shifts the overall balance toward atherogenic lipids and lipoprotein profiles. Lipoprotein(a) has been shown to  have  significantly  increased  in  postmenopausal  patients which  is  an  important  marker  of  cardiac  risk.6,7  Elevated levels  of  lipoprotein(a)  has  been  associated  with  premature atherosclerosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction in various case  control  studies.8-10  Further  the  role  of  coagulation factors,  anticoagulation  substances,  and  a  balance  between fibrinolytic and antifibrinolytic elements of the blood play a major  role  in  development  of  atherogenic  plaque.  Elevated levels  of  fibrinogen  and  factor  VII  in  postmenopausal  than in premenopausal women of the same age has been shown in  various  population-based  studies.11-13  Also  increased incidences  of  thromboembolic  phenomenon14  and  CHD15 have been found in congenital deficiencies of the coagulation inhibitors  antithrombin  III,  protein  C,  and  protein  S. Increased  plasma  concentrations  of  plasminogen  activator inhibitor-1  (PAI-1)  and  tissue  plasminogen  activator  (tPA) antigen  ultimately  causes  a  reduced  function  of  fibrinolytic system and increases the chances of CHD (Box 1).16,17 Various prothrombotics increase in menopausal BOX 1 state (cid:120)(cid:3) Plasminogen activator (cid:120)(cid:3) Lipoprotein(a) inhibitor-1 (cid:120)(cid:3) Fibrinogen (cid:120)(cid:3) Tissue plasminogen activator (cid:120)(cid:3) Factor VII"

      "left": "EFFECTS OF HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY ON CORONARY HEART DISEASE RISK The  administration  of  HRT  induces  variable  amount  of significant metabolic changes in women’s body. The actual effect  of  administered  therapy  depends  upon  a  number  of factors  like  type  of  steroid  used,  dose  of  steroid,  mode  of administration,  duration  of  therapy,  and  most  importantly patients response is also individual. Estrogen substantially lowers  the  LDL  cholesterol  in  turn  lowering  the  total cholesterol  and  this  effect  is  more  evident  by  oral  route of  administration  rather  than  transdermal  route.18  Other protective  roles  (Box  2)  of  estrogen  include  increasing  the levels  of  HDL  cholesterol  particularly  the  HDL2  subfraction. Similarly, it also lowers the levels of lipoprotein(a) an important  cardiovascular  risk  marker.  The  most  notorious particles  causing  atherosclerosis  are  the  small  and  dense LDL  particles  because  of  their  capacity  to  get  retained  in the  arterial  wall  leading  to  production  of  foam  cells  and generating  atheromatous  plaques.  Oral  HRT  increases  the overall clearance of small LDL particles from the circulation and  is  thus  protective  against  CVD.19  These  benefits  are however  not  observed  with  transdermal  route  of  HRT.20 Endogenous  triglycerides  are  another  important  CVD  risk parameter  which  is  also  influenced  by  the  dose,  route, and  duration  of  HRT.  Thus,  transdermal  estrogen  decline triglyceride  levels  but  oral  estrogens  increase  their  level because of first-pass metabolism.18,21 Addition  of  progestogens  to  HRT  does  not  lower  LDL. By  increasing  hepatic  lipase  activity  androgenic  pro gestogens  such  as  norgestrel,  attenuate  the  HDL-raising  effect of  estrogen.21  While  certain  nonandrogenic  progestogens, such as dydrogesterone, do not attenuate estrogen-induced increases  in  HDL22  others,  such  as  medroxy progesterone acetate  (MPA),  have  negative  impact  on  estrogen-induced increases  in  HDL.  Levonorgestrel  being  an  androgenic progestogen  decreases  triglyceride  levels  by  reducing  the secretion of very LDL. Increase in triglycerides induced by oral estrogens is not prevented by addition of C21 progestogens. Thus,  dual  estrogen/progestogen  HRT  can  increase  HDL and  triglycerides,  or  it  can  decrease  triglycerides,  but  at  the same time causes a decrease, or no increase, in HDL. Which change  in  lipid  profile  is  more  important  in  terms  of  CHD benefit  remains  unknown.  In  certain  situations,  it  has  been postulated  that  the  some  HRT  regimens  can  benefit  more than others.

      "right": "CHAPTER  4 Hormone Replacement Therapy and Cardiovascular Diseases Estrogen affects the metabolism and levels of insulin as well. The dynamics of glucose and insulin concentrations in postmenopausal women changes, usually improving insulin resistance after oral administration of 17-estradiol whereas, estradiol  when  given  transdermally  does  not  exert  much effects.23 In contrast, raised insulin levels and impair glucose tolerance have been linked with alkylated estrogens such as ethinylestradiol, and conjugated equine estrogens (CEE).24 Addition  of  progesterone  to  HRT  regime  affects  insulin metabolism  as  androgenic  progesterones  produce  more insulin  resistance  whereas  nonandrogenic  progesterones does  not  have  much  effects.  Oral  estrogen  reduces  certain pro thrombotic  clotting  factors  like  fibrinogen  and  factor VII,  and  also  reduces  the  antifibrinolytic  factor  PAI-1, still  producing  increase  in  thrombo genesis.25  A  continuous combined transdermal HRT resulted in a significant decrease  in  factor  VIIc,  and  an  increase  in  fibrinolytic activity.  Estradiol  also  exerts  beneficial  effects  in  terms  of CVD  by  maintaining  endothelial  function  and  reducing angiotensin  converting  enzyme  activity  which  has  been reported with both oral and transdermal HRT.26 CLINICAL STUDIES OF HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE Observational  studies  done  worldwide  have  consistently shown  that  HRT  is  associated  with  a  reduced  incidence  of CHD  and  total  mortality  in  postmenopausal  women.  Five randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  which  have  used  total mortality and morbidity as end point was conducted (Box 3). Out  of  five,  three  were  secondary  prevention  trials27-29  and two  were  primary  prevention.30-32  RCTs  conducted  on  HRT failed to show any beneficial effect on CHD and mortality in postmenopausal  women.  In  contrary  to  RCT,  observational studies  have  shown  a  30–50%  reduction  in  CHD  and  total mortality  when  analyzed  among  all  women  regardless  of age.  This  difference  between  observational  studies  and RCTs  is  best  exemplified  within  the  WHI  that  evaluated HRT in both an observational cohort and in RCTs. The WHI observational study arm conducted in 53,054 women showed a  50%  reduction  in  CHD  in  women  who  used  estrogen +  progestin  (E+P)  in  contrast  with  women  who  do  not. Whereas in RCT arm, the risk of CHD was increased 18% in women on combined CEE 0.625 mg + MPA 2.5 mg relative to Randomized control trials for hormone BOX 3 replacement therapy in coronary artery disease Secondary prevention trials: (cid:120)(cid:3) HERS (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study) (cid:120)(cid:3) ESPRIT (Estrogen in the Prevention of Reinfarction Trial ) (cid:120)(cid:3) PHASE (Papworth HRT Atherosclerosis Study) Primary prevention trials: (cid:120)(cid:3) WHI-EP (Women’s Health Initiative Estrogen + Progestin Trial) (cid:120)(cid:3) WHI-E (Women’s Health Initiative Estrogen Trial) 21 HRT, hormone replacement therapy."

In  observational studies, women who used HRT were relatively young (30–60 years old), had recent menopause, were thin [approximate  body  mass  index  (BMI)  of  25  kg/m2]  and  were  having typical menopausal symptoms for which HRT initiated. HRT in  these  patients  was  continued  for  longer  periods  (10–40 years).  On  the  other  hand,  in  RCTs  women  who  used  HRT were much older (>90% of women older than 55 years) and on average more than 10 years beyond menopause (average 13–23  years).  Patients  having  predominant  menopausal symptoms  were  excluded  from  RCT  arm.  Mean  duration  of HRT (1–6.8 years) in RCT arm was also considerably less than that of the HRT users in observational studies. Also, women in RCT arm were overweight (approximate BMI of 29 kg/m2). It has been shown that the characteristics of women in RCTs were markedly different from those studied in observational studies.  Thus,  accounting  for  the  discordance  of  the  HRT effects  on  CHD  and  mortality  from  observational  studies compared to RCTs among women regardless of age. Although,  in  RCTs  the  effect  of  HRT  on  CHD  over  all ages is null, these trials also showed that there are beneficial effects of HRT on CHD according to the timing of initiation of HRT relative to age and menopause.33 The largest RCT WHI had  shown  that  compared  to  placebo,  women  who  were randomized  to  CEE  +  MPA  within  10  years  of  menopause had a 12% decrease in CHD events whereas women between 10  and  20  years  after  menopause  had  a  23%  increased  risk of  CHD  and  women  more  than  20  years  after  menopause had  a  66%  increased  risk  of  CHD  (p  =  0.05).34  In  WHI  trial, only  one-third  were  less  than  60  years  old  and  less  than 5%  were  within  a  few  years  of  menopause,  representing the  subgroup  of  women  found  in  observational  studies who  had  reduction  in  CHD  with  HRT.  Whereas,  older women  (>60  years  old)  who  were  given  HRT  many  years after  menopause  (>10  years)  thus  not  representing  the women in observational studies had increased risk of CHD with  HRT.  The  standard  dose  of  estrogen  used  for  relief of  vasomotor  symptoms  in  women  aged  around  50  years may  be  inappropriately  high  for  women  some  15–20  years older.27 The enormous data available after meta-analysis of RCTs  emphasize  that  young  post menopausal  women  who started HRT in close proximity to menopause have reduced CHD and total mortality. These results are also in accordance with the results seen in observational studies where almost all the women started HRT in close proximity to menopause, typically  within  6  years.  Large  RCTs  (HERS  and  WHI-EP), observational  studies,  arterial  imaging  studies,  and  casecontrol  studies  consistently  showed  reduction  in  CHD  risk with prolonged HRT use (>6 years). Majority  of  adverse  outcomes  associated  with  HRT as  shown  in  WHI  and  other  RCTs  are  rare  (<1  event  per 1,000  treated  women).35  Younger  women  who  started  on HRT  had  lower  adverse  outcome  as  compared  to  older women who started on HRT later. Adverse effects like stroke 22",
      "right": "and venous thromboembolism are rare and having incidence similar  to  commonly  prescribed  drugs.  In  WHI,  the  breast cancer risk differ with CEE alone associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk36 and combined CEE + MPA associated with an increased risk,37 the magnitude of risk seen with statin therapy is comparable to that of CEE + MPA therapy.35 CONCLUSION The  combined  data  from  various  RCTs  and  observational studies  indicate  that  the  effect  of  postmenopausal  HRT on  CHD  and  total  mortality  is  influenced  by  the  timing  of initiation (age and time since menopause) and the duration of  therapy  (>6  years  of  use).  The  adverse  events  associated with HRT are rare (<1 additional event per 1,000 women) and even rarer in younger age women (<60 years or within 5 years of menopause). The adverse risk with estrogen alone is quite rare.  In  women  with  confirmed  CHD,  HRT  should  not  be initiated for preventing future cardiovascular events. Women who  are  already  taking  HRT  for  noncardiac  conditions,  if develops  CVD,  can  continue  to  take  it  if  they  are  stable.  If HRT is to be given for the sole purpose of preventing future cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing CHD post should be considered only after a careful risk assessment. At present, the indications for HRT use are relief of menopausal symptoms, maintenance of quality of  life  and  prevention  of  osteoporosis.  Prevention  of  CHD has  never  been  a  licensed  indication.  It  is,  however,  clearly possible  to  use  appropriate  HRT  regimens  safely  in  women at increased risk of CHD or with established disease. Patient preference  as  well  as  noncardiovascular  risks  and  benefits should guide any decision regarding such therapy. In the final analysis, the difference in CHD and total mortality outcomes between  observational  studies  and  RCTs  is  reflected  by  the differences in the study design and the characteristics of the populations studied. In fact, data from RCTs and more than 40  consistent  observational  studies  indicate  that  the  young postmenopausal  women  with  menopausal  symptoms  who use HRT for long periods of time have lower rates of CHD and total  mortality  than  comparable  postmenopausal  women who do not use HRT.

      "left": "Cholesterol and Coronary Artery Disease Controversy Rajiv Bajaj INTRODUCTION Our  understanding  of  diseases  of  civilization  and  modern lifestyle have undergone a sea change over the last 50 years. Cholesterol  has  become  synonymous  with  heart  attacks. There is widespread anxiety about good and bad cholesterol. Cholesterol dictates current food preferences. CHOLESTEROL AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE CONTROVERSY Diseases of Civilization and Modern Lifestyle Over the last 50 years, cholesterol has become synonymous with  heart  attacks.  There  is  widespread  anxiety  about  good and  bad  cholesterol.  Cholesterol  dictates  current  food preferences. Alcohol is often recommended for raising highdensity  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholesterol.  Butter  and  eggs  are feared.  Before  the  war,  glucose  was  blamed  for  diabetes, obesity,  atherosclerosis,  cancer,  and  all  other  diseases  of modern  lifestyle.1  These  diseases  were  called  saccharine diseases.2  The  original  connotation  of  modern  lifestyle  was adopting  agriculture,  living  on  crops  rich  in  glucose,  being prone to glucose diseases. Medical journals, textbooks, and conferences emphasize cholesterol,  but  some  landmark  research  work  and  a  few popular books oppose this view. Clearly, both sides cannot be entirely right or wrong. When we weigh the evidence for and against cholesterol, and look at its chemistry, we can discern its role, and the cause of confusion. Cholesterol Hypothesis Cholesterol  has  been  implicated  in  pathogenesis  of  atherosclerosis  because  of  rabbit  experiments,  cholesterol  in atheroma,  premature  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  in familial  hypercholesterolemia  (FH),  population  studies  of blood lipids, efficacy of statins or PCSK9 inhibitors; and diet",
      "right": "5CHAPTER studies like Oslo Diet-Heart Study and Lifestyle Heart Study (Dean Ornish). Rabbits  are  herbivores,  and  plants  do  not  contain  cholesterol.  Unlike  rabbits,  omnivores  tolerate  high-cholesterol diets. Their natural diet contains animal products, and excess cholesterol can be excreted in bile. Cholesterol  is  suspected  because  of  its  presence  in atheromas. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reaches wherever there  is  tissue  damage  and  cell  multiplication.  Serum cholesterol  levels  therefore  fall  after  infarction,  stroke, fracture,  sepsis,  burns,  and  cancers.  Low-grade  vascular injury  and  inflammation  attracts  circulating  LDL  to  vessel walls, their association is akin to that of wounds and bandages. Familial  hypercholesterolemia  predisposes  to  atherosclerosis. There are fewer hepatic LDL receptors in FH, and the catabolism of LDL is slow. When Framingham statisticians found  no  relation  between  circulating  cholesterol  level  and infarctions  in  their  population,  younger  men  were  divided into  cholesterol  quartiles  after  excluding  older  men  and  all women.  The  highest  quartile  was  a  distillate  of  premature infarctions  due  to  FH.  This  is  the  epidemiological  evidence that implicates cholesterol. Circulating  lipids  levels  correlate  with  atherosclerotic risk  because  LDL  and  HDL  levels  change  with  diet.  These changes are largely caused by dietary carbohydrates, as these are converted into triglycerides, VLDL, and then small dense LDL  by  body.  Diets  rich  in  unsaturated  fatty  acids  do  shift cholesterol  from  blood  stream  to  cell  membranes,  but  this is  related  to  cholesterol’s  role  in  structural  strength,  not  to atherosclerosis. PURE and Other Contradictory Studies Two recent studies have raised concerns about low-fat, lowcholesterol  diet  (LFLC)  for  preventing  heart  disease,  and reopened  an  old  controversy  that  was  never  fully  resolved. PURE,  a  large  prospective  cohort  study3  identified  a  strong positive  correlation  between  carbohydrate  content  of  diet"

      "left": "SECTION  2 Lipids and Diet and  hard  end  points.  PREDIMED,  both  initial  and  recent revised versions, too showed that adding nuts and olive oil is better than a LFLC diet. Initial diet trials had repeatedly raised similar  concerns.  In  anticoronary  club  trial,  and  Minnesota Coronary Survey,4 mortality was higher with LFLC diet. These results had even precipitated a change in design of subsequent diet  studies  of  1970s.  Multiple  risk  factor  intervention  trial (MRFIT),  WHO  factories  study,  and  many  others,  therefore employed  multiple  preventive  measures  simultaneously. Thus  the  treatment  arm  stopped  smoking,  controlled  blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs, exercised, and adopted LFLC diet. Despite a design that maximally favored the LFLC diet, these trials too, were negative. Curiously, lessons from the preceding diet trials began to hit their authors’ blind spots. MRFIT  blamed  antihypertensive  drugs  for  killing  the  LCFC diet  group,  and  WHO  factories  study  opined  that  stopping smoking  is  lethal!  Later,  the  randomized  Harvard’s  nurses’ health study reported that increasing fruits, vegetables, olive oil,  whole  grains,  and  decreasing  red  meats,  butter,  sugar, etc.  did  not  protect  the  heart.  Currently,  these  randomized controlled trials are discounted, and fruits and vegetables are vigorously promoted based on statistical association found in inter heart case–control survey. The  studies  that  implicate  dietary  cholesterol  are  fewer. Oslo is a small post-hoc subanalysis of a negative trial, Ornish’s even  smaller  trial  could  not  be  reproduced  in  subsequent studies,  Lyon’s  heart  study5  a  single  center  publication claimed  80%  reduction  in  events  with  Mediterranean  diet. Like  its  daughter,  Indo-Mediterranean  study,  it  crumbled under scrutiny. The celebrated diet was regular food cooked in canola margarine, and India’s mustard oil version lost all its raw data to termites. Nevertheless,  there  is  a  definite  association  between choles terol  and  atherosclerosis,  and  biochemistry  clarifies its role. FUNCTIONS OF CHOLESTEROL All nucleated animal cells synthesize cholesterol. In addition, dietary cholesterol is absorbed, and delivered to liver. Eating cholesterol  does  not  affect  blood  levels  in  humans,  since synthesis and excretion are regulated. Requirements increase in illnesses and during cell multiplication. Animals have cholesterol for the same reason that plants have cellulose. Cholesterol stabilizes cell membranes, pro vides structural strength, and regulates membrane permeability. Circulating  lipoproteins  have  immune  functions.  They adsorb,  internalize  and  isolate  circulating  bacterial  endotoxins and all other injurious fat soluble debris, and deliver these  to  liver  for  catabolism.  Liver  secretes  fresh,  buoyant, cholesterol-rich  LDL,  and  removes  old,  toxin-laden  small dense LDL (sdLDL). LDL is not a blood pollutant, it is body’s blood and tissue cleansing device. Soluble Nutrients and Very-low-density Lipoprotein Synthesis After  digestion,  water-soluble  nutrients  like  amino  acids 28 go  via  portal  vein  to  the  liver;  insoluble  nutrients  like",
      "right": "triglycerides and cholesterol form chylomicrons, and directly enter general circulation. The  foremost  health  difference  between  modern  and primitive  diets  is  in  their  glucose  content.  Modern  crops like  sugarcane,  grains,  and  tubers  contain  mostly  glucose. Blood levels of glucose and amino acids are tightly regulated. Excess amounts, and all miscellaneous soluble nutrients like pentose,  organic  acids,  alcohols,  etc.  are  mostly  converted to  triglycerides,  enter  circulation  as  very low  density lipoproteins (VLDL). Although conversion of dietary glucose to  triglycerides  prevents  hyperglycemia,  VLDL  does  not adsorb  endotoxins  efficiently.  VLDL  is  LDL  that  has  been reassigned  to  transport  of  soluble  calories  from  intestine to  liver  to  adipose  cells.  VLDL  becomes  sdLDL.  LDL  is  not homo genous; assorted particles are collectively measured as LDL.  Fresh  LDL  from  liver  is  healthy,  VLDL  remnants,  and aged-LDL require elimination by liver. Thus,  the  body  sends  fats  directly  into  blood  stream  as chylomicrons,  and  converts  all  soluble  nutrients  including milk and fruit to triglycerides before permitting them to enter the circulation. Lipoproteins Triglycerides  of food  reaches  tissues in  chylomicrons (apolipoprotein  B48).  Depleted  chylomicrons  (remnants) containing  dietary  cholesterol,  fat  soluble  vitamins,  etc. are  internalized  by  hepatocytes.  Fasting  chylomicronemia occurs  when  peripheral  lipase  activity  is  diminished  (e.g., obese,  alcoholic  diabetics),  and  produces  severe  hypertriglyceridemia. High levels of circulating remnants promote atherosclerosis.  This  happens  in  rabbit  experiments,  and rarely in humans (broad beta disease). Genetic chylomicron clearance disorders are aggravated by high-fat diets. Very-low-density  lipoprotein  and  LDL  (apolipoprotein B100)  are  synthesized  in  liver.  On  a  natural  “forest”  diet, the  triglycerides  come  from  food  (animal  fat),  and  glucose is manufactured in liver. Synthesis of triglycerides in liver is meagre. Blood level of VLDL and sdLDL is low. Liver secretes cholesterol-rich large LDL. Modern  livers  are  kept  busy  synthesizing  triglycerides from glucose, secreting VLDL and removing VLDL remnants. This predisposes to fatty liver, and elevates blood VLDL and sdLDL. Apolipoprotein  A  is  secreted  by  intestine  and  liver.  It interacts  with  circulating  lipoproteins  and  tissues,  adsorbs lipids, and delivers them to LDL and to liver. It is a mop for toxins  and  a  mobile  service  station  for  plasma  lipoproteins. Its levels therefore vary inversely with VLDL levels. Theories of Atherosclerosis According  to  cholesterol  theory  synthesis  of  LDL  by  liver  is excessive,  and  this  is  due  to  fat  or  cholesterol  in  diet.  High levels  of  LDL  clog  the  arteries.  This  theory  ignores  the  role of  glucose  in  VLDL  synthesis,  the  formation  of  sdLDL  from VLDL, and does not explain the absence of atherosclerosis in primitive tribes, (targets for primordial prevention), presence in ancient Egyptians; equivocal mortality benefits of second line antilipid drugs and exercise."

      "left": "Endothelial  injury  by  hypertension,  cigarette  smoke, uremic toxins,  hyperhomocysteinemia,  pollutants,  etc. leads  to  local  inflammatory  response.  Glucose  too,  causes endo thelial  injury.  It  is  a  reactive  aldehyde.  It  glycosylates numerous  proteins  like  hemoglobin,  endothelial  adhesion protein,  etc.  Injury  leads  to  inflammation  and  healing. Arteries,  like  other  tissues,  have  stereotyped  response  to diverse  injuries.  Chronic  low-grade  endothelial  injury  leads to atherosclerosis. Ancient  Egyptians  were  wheat  and  barley  farmers,  they had adopted the modern, glucose-rich diet. Neel and many others  have  shown  that  glucose-naive  populations  are  very susceptible  to  glucose  injury.  (Neel  conclusively  disproved his own “thrifty gene” hypothesis). Statins deplete hepatic cholesterol. This increases hepatic LDL  receptors,  and  sdLDL  uptake. Thus,  statins  and  PCSK9 inhibitors  help  by  removing  toxic  sdLDL.  Low  hepatocyte cholesterol  marginally  depresses  VLDL  synthesis,  and therefore  raises  blood  sugar.  Removal  of  old,  spent,  toxinladen  small  dense  LDL  is  helpful,  removal  of  fresh  buoyant LDL cannot be. Fanciful and illogical extrapolations of “LDL targets”  are  advocated  for  “eradicating  atherosclerosis” despite  evidence  that  aggressive  LDL  lowering  increases nonvascular adverse events. Advantages and Disadvantages of Glucose Glucose  is  the  explosive,  emergency  fuel  for  phagocytosis, sprinting,  and  anoxic  tissues.  Natural  diet  has  very  little glucose,  the  liver  synthesizes  it.  Blood  levels  are  50–80  mg, rising moderately in fever, injury, and other emergencies. Carbohydrates increase serum insulin and somatomedins, they  are  growth  factors.  Lactose  produces  rapid  growth  in breast-fed  infants.  Human  body  size  is  diminutive  without cooking (pygmies), small with cooked natural diet, gigantic in glucose fed modern humans as it is in farmed animals. When  rice  and  flour  entered  India,  physicians  documented that they cause diabetes (madhumai).1 Carbohydrate reduction  was  standard  treatment  for  thousands  of  years. Current  advice  is  riddled  with  contradictions.  Fats  are curtailed, forcing diabetics to take a high-glucose diet. Whole grains are recommended for lowering glycemic index, though they  cannot  match  the  spectacularly  low  glycemic  index  of fats. Voglibose and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors  are  prescribed  for  blocking  absorption  of  glucose by intestines and kidneys, though fat is the one that is feared. Rapid weight loss occurs in type 1 diabetes because low blood insulin promotes catabolism of body fat. Conversely, hyperinsulinemia  promotes  fat  synthesis.  Carbohydrate restriction is therefore effective in obesity, calorie counting is not. Cancer cells have damaged genes. They lack the complex organization  essential  for  oxidative  phosphorylation,  are prone  to  cell  death.  On  a  high-glucose  diet,  they  survive  by anaerobic  glycolysis  and  cause  cancer.  In  vitro  cancer  cell lines require glucose and insulin, and glucose PET (positron emission tomography) scanning locates various cancers.",
      "right": "CHAPTER  5 Cholesterol and Coronary Artery Disease Controversy A  simple  rule  has  long  existed,  if  diabetes  predisposes to  any  condition,  its  cause  is  probably  dietary  glucose. Glycosylation of lens causes cataracts; joint cartilage, osteoarthritis; advanced glycated-end products, dementia. The long list of modern diseases needs further additions like  glaucoma,  hypothyroidism.  Diabetic  mothers  get eclampsia,  dystocia,  cesarean  sections;  their  babies  macrosomia,  growth  retardation,  congenital  defects.  Even  many cardiac  arrhy thmias  may  be  due  to  altered  autonomic function.  Do  autoimmune  diseases,  allergies,  and  many infectious diseases result from abnormal immune responses to innocuous environmental chemicals and microbes? (cid:47)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:191)(cid:79)(cid:72) Absolute risk estimation is needed for calculating sensitivity, specificity  and  receiver  operator  curves.  Lipidology  emphasizes  relative  risk.  Sensitivity,  specificity,  etc.  are  never calculated. The various risk calculators combine all risk factors like age, diabetes, tobacco apart from lipids, to separate 20% 10  year  risk  from  10%.  Even  this  modest  achievement  is suspect. There are equally significant inverse relationships between serum  cholesterol  and  neuropsychiatric  problems,  cancers, and even lifespan. Remnant  chylomicrons  (B48),  fresh  LDL  from  liver, spent  LDL,  and  VLDL,  are  all  measured  together  as  LDL. Athero genic  spent  particles  are  lumped  together  with health ful fresh LDL. Low-density lipoprotein  is emphasized; triglycerides are discounted,  though  LDL  changes  are  downstream  effects of  triglyceride  synthesis  in  liver.  High  triglycerides  and  low HDL are the commonest findings in diabetes and infarctions (“atherogenic dyslipidemia”). The obvious triglyceride/HDL ratio, which is automatically the most robust, is ignored. EARLY RESEARCH ON CHOLESTEROL The  cholesterol  saga  started  immediately  after  England won  World  War-2  and  “dissolved”  the  Empire.6  Diagnosis of myocardial infarctions had increased with availability of electrocardiogram (ECG). In USA, this was projected as an epidemic  of  heart  disease.  Government  announced  grand investment in research for rapid action against “the number one  killer”,  as  “its  cause  was  unknown”.  A  Harvard  doctor prepared a list of all known and suspected associations like diabetes,  smoking,  etc.,  and  an  observational  study  began in  Framingham.  Decades  were  consumed  in  prospectively obtaining “p” values for already listed associations. This was then  projected  as  extensive  research,  which  lamentably, “failed  to  find  the  cause,  but  identified  risk  factors”.  The weak  association  between  cholesterol  and  infarctions appeared  very  late,  and  only  by  excluding  all  women,  and most  men  from  analysis.  This  toehold  triggered  relentless campaigning  on  dangers  of  cholesterol.  Diabetes  had  the strongest  association,  but  it  was  discounted  for  another 29 decade.  These  decades  of  cholesterol  education  gradually"

The  original  promises  of  world  class  research  under  the guidance of leading authorities and reputed medical bodies were  renegaded.  Start-ups  like  American  Heart  Association were  handed  over  reins  and  finance  to  dominate.  At Framingham, a group of statisticians worked under a single, unknown,  and  disillusioned  internist  for  6  years.  Kannel, a  young  war  veteran  next  became  the  sole  medical  expert of  the  haloed  Framingham  Study.  He  is  hailed  as  “father  of prevention”! The treatment research limb of the government’s war  against  heart  disease  was  shifted  to  Bethesda,  over 400  miles  away.  It  kept  busy  conducting  lengthy  trials  of cholesterol. Their negative results were vigorously massaged to obtain some favorable p values. Those negative studies are still quoted as evidence in favor of cholesterol hypothesis. Even  as  Framingham  and  National  Institute  of  Health (NIH) began their slow charade, an army strongman started marketing  dietary  cholesterol  as  the  cause  of  heart  disease. Ancel keys had no background of research or heart diseases, but  he  was  an  old  friend  of  the  government,  he  had  helped to  slash  costs  of  feeding  US  soldiers  by  developing  and summarily  approving  the  infamous  K  ration.  He  imposed cholesterol  as  the  cause  of  heart  problems,  concealing or  trashing  all  research  that  suggested  the  opposite,  and showcasing  his  six  and  seven  countries  Studies.  Both  were fudged  and  silly.  After  his  retirement  his  juniors  exposed his  duplicity  by  publishing  his  large  randomized  trial  that showed  the  opposite  of  what  he  preached,  a  trial  he  had deliberately  buried.4  Immediately,  almost  on  cue,  Ornish, a  Californian  nonentity  with  unreliable  data,  became  the messiah of preventing heart disease by reducing fat in diet. In Europe, a single obscure author claimed stupendous benefits of  “Mediterranean  Diet”,  spawning  the  humbug  of  “IndoMediterranean Diet”. Cholesterol lobby promotes weak statistical associations a  causal,  projects  unreliable  studies,  but  buries  strong studies,  biochemistry  and  physiology.  Till  recently,  Inter Heart  emphasized  that  over  90%  of  the  risk  is  “accounted for”  by  conventional  risk  factors,  and  asserted  that  these, therefore,  cause  atherosclerosis.  PURE  study  implicates carbohydrates.  By  analogy,  if  studies  are  conducted  of  why cars  breakdown,  we  may  discover  many  risk  factors  like number  of  dents,  presence  of  carburetor,  absence  of  GPS, tampered  mileometer,  age  and  financial  status  of  owner, etc. and these may identify 95% of all cars that stop. Old cars tend  to  breakdown  after  running  hundred  thousand  miles. To  “discover”  this  we  require  analysis  of  car  mileage;  not complex statistics. DIET AND HEALTH To understand food, we must focus on nutrients that enter the body  after  digestion  and  absorption.  Speed  of  assimilation matters  less;  physical  appearances,  antioxidants,  etc.  are mostly irrelevant. Biochemically, logical guidance about food has been replaced by charts that curtail fat and cholesterol, 30 optimize  blood  lipids,  and  glorify  obscure  trace  substances.",
      "right": "Confusion  abounds:  (1)  Indigestible  items  (fiber)  have been  declared  healthy.  (2)  Almonds,  honey,  bottle  gourds, pomegranates,  etc.  are  ascribed  mystical  health  effects.  (3) Jargons  like  “junk  foods”,  empty  calories,  fast  food,  antioxidants abound. (4) Very similar foods are ascribed opposite health  effects,  e.g.,  apples  healthy,  mangoes  unhealthy; almonds good; and cashew bad. Cooking oils have spawned an elaborate pseudoscience. All triglycerides are nutritionally almost identical, providing nine  glucose-free  calories  per  gram.  Their  glycerol  is identical.  Unsaturated  fatty  acids  decrease  phospholipid bilayer rigidity, necessitating cholesterol redistribution from blood to cell membranes. On a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol shifts out of plasma, and serum levels are transiently  depressed.  Though  projected  as  barometers  of heart health, these shifts are irrelevant to atherosclerosis. Beliefs  about  dietary  sodium  are  equally  illogical. Glomeruli filter over 1,200 g of salt daily, of which over 99.5% is reabsorbed in tubules. Glomerular and tubular functions are under exquisite, independent and multiple controls. Beliefs that 4 g of salt daily is healthy, seven is dangerous, amounts to believing that if glomeruli filter 1,252 g salt daily, and tubules reabsorb 1,250, it is healthy, but altering these loads by even 0.1% is deleterious.

Food  should  provide  calories  and  all  essential  nutrients  in adequate  quantities.  Vitamin  B12  and  iron  require  special attention  in  vegetarians.  The  diet  should  be  palatable  and affordable. Adults: Basic rules are: do not be scared of eating; calorie counting  is  not  needed  for  calories  that  come  from  fat;  fats are  healthier  than  glucose,  especially  in  sedentary  lifestyle; high-fat,  low-glucose  diet  is  good  for  heart;  quantity  of  fats should be increased, quality (olive oil, cold pressed oils, cows ghee,  walnuts,  etc.)  adds  more  expense  than  value;  transfats of vanaspati ghee, margarine, bakery, sometimes eatery or  party  food,  should  be  avoided;  high  protein  is  not  very good, so consider protein a nutrient, not fuel; reduce glucose by  curtailing  sugar,  jaggery,  and  by  increasing  fat  in  food; restrict  glucose  to  amounts  that  can  be  stored  as  glycogen. Thus,  physically  active  people  may  increase  starchy  foods, but match their intake to their expenditure from day-to-day, perhaps  from  meal-to-meal.  These  rules  will  prevent  heart disease, cancers, various surgeries, and ensure longevity. Poor man’s heart healthy diet would have liberal amounts of  cheap  fats;  (refined  vegetable  oil,  palm  oil,  palm  oil saturated fraction), starch titrated to activity levels, cheapest vegetables and animal foods (eggs, and milk), small multiple meals,  and  frugality  of  sugar,  jaggery,  and  total  calories  to avoid hyperinsulinemia. Ovo-lacto  vegetarians  should  think  of  animal  foods  as healthy,  reduce  sugar  and  increase  fat.  There  can  be  no single  diet  for  children.  Those  planned  for  sumo  wrestling, basketball, equestrian jobs, etc. would require tailored diets"

Carbohydrates  make  us  large.  Six  feet  humans  are  now  common. Forest tribals are much smaller. Cholesterol  is  present  in  animals,  it  is  absent  in  plants. Cholesterol education leads to descending down in the food chain,  from  animal  foods  to  plant  foods.  It  greatly  reduces the  costs  of  feeding  the  population,  the  manpower  and hectares required for production of food. It releases surplus manpower  for  urbanization,  infrastructure,  and  businesses. Massive  urbanization  is  possible;  a  world  populated  by dependent,  compliant  city  folk.  Exercise  is  essential  for preserving health on a glucose-rich diet. The body has limited capacity for storing glycogen. In sedentary lifestyle, muscles contain glycogen and are insulin resistant. This predisposes to  metabolic  syndrome,  diabetes,  obesity,  and  thrombosis. Exercise  depletes  muscle  glucose  and  improves  insulin sensitivity, though it also increases wear and tear. The need for rest is equally important for health, but it is now seldom mentioned,  even  to  patients  discharged  after  myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or major surgery. There are numerous publications on value of exercise in heart failure, but not of rest. Thus, cholesterol education leads to gigantic, hard-working,  city  dwellers  maintained  on  cheap  food;  to  a productive, docile, innocent workforce. The cholesterol myth fuels our prosperity. PRESENT AND FUTURE Structural  integrity  of  cell  membranes  and  isolation  of lipo philic  toxins  from  blood  stream  are  vital  functions  of cholesterol.  Cholesterol  occurs  in  atheromas  because  it reaches  wherever  there  is  tissue  injury.  A  high-glucose  diet engages  hepatocytes  in  triglyceride  synthesis,  and  toxin clearance  slows.  Excessive  dietary  glucose  can  cause  many other direct harmful effects, glycosylation of proteins, hyperinsulinemia.  Reducing  glucose  in  diet,  SGLT2  inhibitors, or  even  exercise,  may  provide  greater  benefit  than  mere reduction of toxic sdLDL with drugs. Medical  establishments,  governments,  and  media  have not  resolved  the  cholesterol  controversy.  Clearly,  some higher  power  enforces  the  confusion.  Its  rise  soon  after  the Empire  won  the  war,  and  the  proactive  role  of  the  United",
      "right": "CHAPTER  5 Cholesterol and Coronary Artery Disease Controversy States    government,  suggests  that  above  the  three  branches of  modern  states,  are  other,  bigger  powers.  The  cholesterol myth  is  kept  alive  by  an  all-powerful,  but  invisible,  supergovernment.  If  doctors  were  paid  well  for  knowledge, scientifically sound opinions, longevity of their patients, and very little for ordering or conducting hi-tech procedures, the cholesterol  myth  would  collapse.  The  myth  is  deliberately kept alive by financial clout, and by other invisible influences. Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2  trials  can  be  expected to  show  benefits  for  arteries,  veins,  myocardium,  dementia, cataracts,  glaucoma,  autoimmune  diseases,  cancers,  glomeruli, etc. They will simultaneously show adverse effects on renal tubules and urinary tracts from excess urinary glucose, and little effect on dental caries, dyspepsia, and constipation. These trials may bring home the message of glucose toxicity, ending the cholesterol era. But will the next generation have the  skills  to  make  the  post  cholesterol  world  a  better  place than  our  prosperous,  financially  governed,  global  human farm? CONCLUSION Animals  cell  membranes  contain  cholesterol,  it  makes  us flexible and mobile. Plants use cellulose. LDL and HDL work together  like  mop  and  pail  for  cleaning  the  circulation  of endotoxins, cellular debris, etc. Fresh LDL and HDL are therefore  both  good,  and  old  lipoproteins  are  bad  because  they contain endotoxins. High glucose diets change LDL to VLDL, and  this  becomes  small  dense  LDL,  which  is  atherogenic. Glucose  is  a  reactive  aldehyde  that  causes  glycosylation  of endothelial  adhesion  proteins.  Glucose,  smoke,  etc.  cause endothelial  dysfunction,  inflammation,  and  adhesion  and deposition of small dense LDL causing atherosclerosis. High levels of old LDL or old HDL (familial hypercholesterolemia, alcohol,  torcetrapib)  predispose  to  atherosclerosis,  and statins help by clearing small dense LDL from blood. REFERENCES 1.

Many trials have shown that raised-LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)  is  the  most  common  risk  factor  which  leads  to initiation  and  progression  of  coronary  atherosclerosis. Robust  data  are  available  that  show  that  lowering  its  levels can  regress  and  stabilize  atherosclerotic  vascular  disease.1 Therefore,  management  of  dyslipidemia  is  of  paramount importance to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD). In 2013, the  National  Heart,  Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  (NHLBI),  the American  College  of  Cardiology  (ACC),  and  the  American Heart Association (AHA), released a joint guideline focusing on the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However,  as  evident  by  various  studies,  dyslipidemia  in Indian  population  is  characterized  by  low  HDL  cholesterol (HDL-C) and high TG. High TC and LDL-C are less common in  Indian  patients.  Moreover,  there  are  significant  lifestyle, genetic,  socioeconomic,  and  cultural  differences  in  Indians versus  European  population.  All  these  factors  demand different  treatment  approaches  for  optimal  management  of dyslipidemia  and  CVD.  Also,  prevalence  and  the  pattern  of various risk factors that decides the category of CV risk differ from  European  population  and  therefore,  risk  assessment score  varies.  Apart  from  this,  economical  constraints  on healthcare  expenditure  and  delayed  availability  of  newer agents also leads to different treatment approaches amongst treating  physicians.  Moreover,  the  side  effect  profile  of  the drugs used to treat dyslipidemia, notably statins, also varies from  the  European  to  the  Indian  population.  No  evidencebased  Indian  guidelines  for  dyslipidemia  management considering  all  these  factors  have  been  developed  and therefore, Indian physicians are forced to follow international guidelines  for  their  patients.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  for adapting international guidelines for Indian patients through",

Though Indian  guidelines  for  the  management  of  dyslipidemia are  not  currently  available,  a  consensus  statement  on the  management  of  dyslipidemia  in  Indian  subjects  was published in 2014. And that is why it is a challenge to manage dyslipidemia  in  India  especially  in  the  absence  of  Indiaspecific guidelines.2,3 INDIAN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON DYSLIPIDEMIA Heterogeneous  data  were  showing  an  increasing  secular trend in TC levels, but in view of various limitations and biases in  data,  robustness  of  this  trend  could  not  be  confirmed. Prevalence  of  dyslipidemia  in  India  is  not  adequately documented.  However,  India  Heart  Watch  study  was  a  big epidemiological  survey  of  urban  middle  class  subjects  from 11  major  cities  of  India.  Prevalence  in  men  and  women, respectively were, TC more than 200 mg/dL in 25.1% (men) and 24.9% (women), LDL-C more than 130 mg/dL in 16.3% (men)  and  15.1%  (women)  and  more  than  100  mg/dL  in 49.5% (men) and 49.7% (women), HDL-C less than 40 mg/dL (men) and less than 50 mg/dL (women) in 33.6% and 52.8%, TC:HDL-C  ratio  is  more  than  or  equal  to  4.5  in  29.4%  and 16.8% and TG is more than or equal to 150 mg/dL in 42.1% and 32.9% (Fig. 1).4 India  is  undergoing  a  rapid  epidemiological  transition with  increasing  population,  economic  prosperity,  urbanization  and  aging  with  associated  risk  factor  transition. Adverse lifestyles such as greater smoking and tobacco use, change in nutritional habits with greater intake of unhealthy diets  and  increasing  sedentary  lifestyle  are  also  responsible factors for development of CHD.5 In the Jaipur Heart Watch (JHW)  studies  (six  in  number),  20-year  mean  cholesterol and other lipid parameters were evaluated. Total 712 people of  20–59  years  were  evaluated  in  JHW-1,  558  in  JHW-2,  374 in JHW-3, 887 in JHW-4, 530 in JHW-5, and 1,100 in JHW-6."

It  is  commonly  seen  in  young  patients who  have  a  history  of  MI.

LABORATORY PARAMETERS ASSESSMENT Assessment  of  lipid  profile  is  crucial  to  assess  CV  risk  and to  decide  on  the  treatment.  Traditionally,  assessments are  done  in  fasting  state.  European  Society  of  Cardiology (ESC)  dyslipidemia  guideline  opined  that  both  fasting  and nonfasting  assessment  of  TC,  LDL-C,  and  HDL-C  shows similar  levels,  whereas  higher  TG  levels  (by  27  mg/dL) are  observed  in  nonfasting  state  depending  on  time  and composition of the last meal. In Indian setting, this is even more  due  to  higher  content  of  carbohydrates  in  meal. The  increase  in  TG  levels  in  nonfasting  state  was  seemed important  as  TGs  are  considered  as  strong  CV  risk  factors for  Asian  Indians  and  is  a  characteristic  dyslipidemic component  in  Indians.9,10  Nonfasting  assessments  were considered  helpful  so  that  overcrowding  of  laboratory in  morning  will  be  reduced  and  patients’  preference  to perform  lipid  assessment  increases.  However,  nonfasting lipid  assessment  has  disadvantage  of  unclear  evidence  on time of assessment after meal (whether 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, and so), meal load or composition before assessment, and nonfasting  cut-off  levels  for  each  of  lipid  components.  Thus, fasting  lipid  assessment  is  still  the  gold  standard,  to  be performed  whenever  feasible  with  nonfasting  assessment reserved  for  those  with  CV  risk  assessments,  in  diabetic patients, distant residence patients (first-hand opportunity to screen for dyslipidemia with follow-up fasting evaluation at  3  months).  It  was  suggested  that  for  a  LDL-centric management,  i.e.,  when  physicians  treating  dyslipidemia has kept the target of achieving LDL-C to a goal irrespective of  the  other  lipid  levels,  a  nonfasting  measurement  may prove  equally  useful.3  This  was  also  recommended  by  the European atherosclerosis  society  and  European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine. European  Society  of  Cardiology  recommended  apolipoprotein B (ApoB) as an alternative marker for risk assessment especially  in  those  with  elevated  TGs.11  However,  ApoB 34 is  expensive  for  Indian  setting.  Hence,  it  was  suggested",
      "right": "that  ApoB  should  not  form  a  part  of  routine  dyslipidemia management in Indian setting.3 Lipoprotein-a  [Lp(a)]  was  advised  by  ESC  guideline  as marker for estimation in patients with history of premature CV disease in family and in those with borderline CV risk. Routine Lp(a) estimation is felt to be inappropriate in Indian setting. Further, as Lp(a) estimation techniques are not validated in most laboratories in India, Lp(a) testing is liable to technical errors giving false positive or false negative results. A recent evaluation  from  Banerjee  et  al.12  reported  nonsignificantly higher  trend  for  elevated  Lp(a)  association  with  ischemic heart  disease  (IHD)  in  Asian  Indians  [odds  ratio  (OR)  2.0] and  Chinese  (OR  4.8)  than  non-Hispanic  Whites  (OR  1.4). Lp(a)  assessment  should  be  restricted  to  premature  (at  age <40 years) or recurrent CVD, FH, history of premature CVD in family, and borderline high risk of CV disease.3 INADEQUATE MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN INDIA Epidemiological studies of hypercholesterolemia and dys lipidemia are important for developing strategies for prevention of  CHD.  In  Indian  Heart  Watch  study  awareness  about dyslipidemia  and  its  consequences  among  dyslipidemic population was in 17.5% men and 13.2% women and statins was  given  to  7.5%  men  and  6.7%  women,  while  control  to targets  of  TC  less  than  200  mg/dL  was  in  4.5%  men  and 3.7% women (Fig. 4).1 The PURE study also found low use of secondary  prevention  drugs  and  healthy  lifestyle  practices in  low  income  countries  including  India.  A  study  has  also reported that availability of statins is no longer a problem, still the use is low in India.4 INDIAN GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION ON DYSLIPIDEMIA MANAGEMENT Management of dyslipidemia is a difficult task as not only the pre valence  of  dyslipidemia  is  constantly  increasing,  particularly at a younger age, but also the pattern of dysli pidemia"

It should be noted that therapeutic lifestyle change is  also  recommended  in  all  individuals  who  have  LDL-C  or non-HDL-C values above the desired goals, and preferably in everyone regardless of their cholesterol levels.15 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION: LIPID TARGETS European  Society  of  Cardiology  recommends  cessation  of tobacco use, healthy diet, body weight maintenance, physical activity  (moderate–vigorous  2.5–5  h  per  week),  blood pressure,  and  glycemic  control  (HbA1c  <7%).11  However, healthy diet is one of the most deficient means in CV disease prevention  in  India.  Reducing  carbohydrate  intake  was suggested.  Indian  Council  of  Medical  Research  National Institute of Nutrition Research recommends visible fat intake of 50 g per person per day. It is suggested to limit the use of coconut  oil,  vanaspati,  and  animal  fats  on  the  account  of high amount of saturated fatty acids present in these sources. Further, it is advised to avoid olive oil for cooking in India as it has lower smoking point and may get denatured at cooking temperatures  (deep  frying)  employed  in  routine.3  In  India, lower  waist  circumference  (WC)  cut-off  for  males  (<90  cm) and females (<80 cm) are recommended contrasting to ESC Nonconventional risk markers (cid:120)(cid:3) None (cid:120)(cid:3) CAC score >300 A (cid:120)(cid:3) Carotid plaque (nonstenotic) (cid:120)(cid:3) Lp(a) >50 mg/dL (cid:120)(cid:3) CAC score 100–299 (cid:120)(cid:3) Raised carotid IMT/ aortic PWV (cid:120)(cid:3) Lp(a) 20–49 mg/dL (cid:120)(cid:3) Metabolic syndrome (cid:120)(cid:3) None 35"

LOWERING OF LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN REDUCES RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS Low-density lipoprotein is a major culprit for development of atherosclerosis  and  causes  CAD.  Many  studies  have  shown that  as  much  as  low  LDL  is  better  for  CV  event  reduction. In a meta-analysis of 175,000 participants in 27 randomized trials  of  statins,  the  Cholesterol  Treatment  Trialists,  (CTT) collaborators found that a reduction of 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) in LDL-C levels produced a 21% reduction in major vascular events over 5 years, irrespective of age, sex, base line LDL-C levels and presence or absence of vascular disease.16 DRUGS FOR MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA Statins  remain  the  cornerstone  for  treatment  of  dyslipidemia.  Statins  are  recommended  in  highest  recommended or tolerated dose to reach the goal lipid levels and was agreed unanimously  by  the  panel.  However,  panel  identified  three potential  statins—(1)  atorvastatin,  (2)  rosuvastatin,  and (3) pitavastatin for clinical use in India. Descriptive studies in India have reported maximum utilization of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin to large extent (over 95% of prescriptions) than other statins.17 In the JUPITER trial, 106 people with no prior ASCVD or diabetes with baseline LDL-C less than or equal to 130 mg/dL and  high  sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  more  than  or  equal to  2  mg/L  were  treated  with  rosuvastatin  20  mg/d.  The median LDL-C level attained was 55 mg/dL, as compared to 108 mg/dL at baseline. Those who achieved LDL-C less than 50 mg/dL had 65% reduction in the risk of major CV events and 46% reduction in total mortality. Approximately, 23% of the subjects reached LDL-C level of less than 40 mg/dL. In a 36 post hoc analysis, no adverse effects were seen in this group.18",
      "right": "The ESC recommends use of ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrant,  and  cholesterol  absorption  inhibitors  in  a  sequential manner  as  additional  agents  if  the  goal  is  not  reached  with statin alone. In cases with very high-risk who failed to achieve treatment goal, addition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin  type  9  (PCSK9)  inhibitors  should  be  considered. Panel suggested when lipid goals are not reached, causes of secondary dyslipidemia should be ruled out.11 In  the  IMPROVE-IT  (Improved  Reduction  of  Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy international Trial), with ACS patients mean level of LDL-C was 69.9 mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 53.2 mg/dL in the simvastatin ezetimibe combination group. The  median  follow-up  was  for  7  years.  Primary  endpoint  of CV death, MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization (>3 days), or stroke occurred in 34.7% of the simvastatin group and 32.7% of the simvastatin plus ezetimibe group. The absolute risk reduction was 2% (numbers needed to treat-50) and relative risk reduction was 6.4% (hazard ratio 0.936; CI 0.887–0.988; p = 0.016). There was no safety signal.19 As per experts, to achieve LDL-C target, statins are firstline  agents.  In  India,  rosuvastatin  (5–40  mg),  atorvastatin (10–80  mg),  and  pitavastatin  (1–4  mg)  may  be  used  as  first choice.  In  case  of  failure  to  achieve  goal  LDL-C  with  statin alone,  add  ezetimibe  (10  mg)  as  second  agent  followed  by bile  acid  sequestrant,  and  cholesterol  absorption  inhibitors as  needed.  A  combination  of  statin  (in  lower  doses—e.g., atorvastatin  40  mg  instead  of  80  mg  or  rosuvastatin  20  mg instead  of  40  mg)  with  ezetimibe  may  be  considered  in patients  who  have  significant  adverse  effects  with  statins  or who are diabetic or at high CV risk. DRUGS FOR MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA The ESC recommended that statin should be given to all highrisk patients with TG more than 200 mg/dL and addition of fenofibrate to statin to be considered if target TG of less than 200 mg/dL is not reached with statin alone.11 The risk of CV disease  morbidity  and  mortality  is  increased  significantly in  case  where  estimated  glomerular  filtration  (eGFR)  is  less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Using fenofibrate with statin thus demands  lower  dosage  (75  mg/day)  of  fenofibrate.  Further, reported  prevalence  of  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  in Indians  is  17.2%  with  further  increase  in  diabetic  subset (18.8%) suggests significant burden of CKD. Panel opined that when eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, dose of fenofibrate should not be increased. In patients who have TGs more than 200  mg/dL,  panel  recommends  use  of  fenofibrate  in  a  lowdose with caution in CKD cases and strict implementation of lifestyle modification as a treatment strategy. In CAD cases, who  have  LDL-C  less  than  70  mg/dL  with  TG  more  than 200 mg/dL and HDL-C less than 35 mg/dL, panel suggested use  of  fenofibrate  (75  mg/day)  in  addition  to  statin.  Use  of higher  dose  needs  monitoring  of  eGFR  in  patients.  Where fibrate  is  contraindicated  or  not  tolerated,  there  is  some evidence  of  biochemical  benefit  with  saroglitazar,  a  dual PPAR agonist. This is safe in combination with statin but there is no evidence of its clinical outcome benefit.12,20"

However, the panel felt there is need to prospectively screen patients  for  FH  and  suggested  use  of  clinical  criteria  for screening of FH in India. Panel stressed on assessing arcus cornealis before the age of 45 years especially in upper cornea as simple tool to start screening FH. In association with raised LDL-C (>250 mg/dL), these criteria can provide a clue to the diagnosis of FH. Genetic screening may be positive in ~ 60% cases which were classified as definite FH by clinical criteria. Target LDL-C in FH recommended by ESC guidelines is less than  100  mg/dL  and  less  than  70  mg/dL  without  or  with CVD,  respectively.  In  high  risk  cases  or  in  those  with  CVD or  statin  intolerance,  PCSK9  inhibitor  is  recommended  as treatment.11 DYSLIPIDEMIA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME The  ESC  guidelines  recommend  non-HDL-C  is  less  than 130  mg/dL  and  less  than  100  mg/dL  in  high-risk  and  very high risk cases, respectively. In treating dyslipidemia, statins are  recommended  in  all  type  1  diabetes  and  in  presence of  microalbuminuria  and/or  renal  disease  irrespective  of baseline  LDL-C.  LDL-C  is  less  than  70  mg/dL  (primary) and  non-HDL-C  is  less  than  100  mg/dL  (secondary)  are recommended in type 2 diabetes and CVD/CKD as well as in patients aged more than 40 years without CVD but with one or more CVD risk factor. Further, LDL-C is less than 100 mg/dL (primary) and non-HDL-C more than 130 mg/dL (secondary) is  advised  in  type  2  diabetes  without  any  risk  factor  and/or evidence of target organ damage.11 DYSLIPIDEMIA IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME The ESC recommends early high-dose statin for all cases with ACS  and  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary  intervention (PCI)  despite  normal  baseline  LDL-C  levels.  Addition  of ezetimibe  and  PCSK9  inhibitors  should  be  considered,  if LDL-C  target  is  not  reached  with  statin  alone.  In  statinintolerant  cases,  the  latter  two  may  be  used  alone  or  in combination.  A  goal  LDL-C  is  less  than  70  mg/dL  or  50% reduction from the baseline value. Re-evaluation at 4–6 weeks is  recommended.  A  loading  of  high-dose  statin  before elective PCI or in patients with non-ST elevation ACS should be considered when patients is are already receiving statins. Panel suggested when baseline LDL-C is less than 100 mg/dL in any ACS patients, a target should be 50% reduction from baseline. When the target of less than 50 mg/dL is desirable and is not achieved with statin alone, addition of ezetimibe may be considered.11",
      "right": "CHAPTER  6 Indian Dyslipidemia:  Challenges in Management DYSLIPIDEMIA IN MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE The ESC guidelines identified that CKD stage 3–5 are high or very high-risk for CV disease. Statin with or without ezetimibe is recommended in nondialysis-dependent CKD. In dialysisdependent CKD cases without any CV disease, statins are not to be used. Statin, ezetimibe, or their combination should be continued at the time of dialysis initiation in all and especially in CV disease cases. Amongst two statins commonly used in India,  atorvastatin  dose  was  advised  as  20  mg/day  by  NICE guidelines  for  primary  or  secondary  prevention  of  CVD  in CKD  cases.  These  guidelines  further  advocate  consultation of nephrologist if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and higher dose of atorvastatin is to be used. But, as recommended by ESC guidelines and opined by the panel, any dose of statin may  be  initiated  to  achieve  the  target  LDL-C  is  less  than 70 mg/dL.11 DYSLIPIDEMIA AND STROKE PREVENTION For primary prevention of stroke, statin treatment is recommended to achieve desired goals in high-risk and very high CV risk cases. For secondary prevention of stroke, intensive statin  treatment  is  recommended  by  ESC  guidelines.  ESC guidelines recommend high-dose statin for both primary as well as secondary stroke prevention.11 SAFETY ASSESSMENT DURING PHARMACOTHERAPY IN DYSLIPIDEMIA In  consideration  of  safety  of  statins,  ESC  guidelines recom mend  liver  enzyme  assessment  especially  alanine aminotransferase  (ALT),  at  baseline,  and  once  8–12  weeks post-treatment or after increase in dose. Routine monitoring with ALT, thereafter is not recommended during therapy. If elevation of liver enzymes is over 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), reduce the dose or stop the drug and recheck liver  enzymes  in  4–6  weeks.  Reintroduction  should  be cautiously done after ALT has returned to normal with lower dose  at  the  start  and  then  gradual  increase  with  enzymes monitoring.  Persistent  elevation  in  enzymes  excludes  lipid lowering therapy as a culprit for liver damage. With regards to muscle damage, guideline recommends creatine kinase (CK) assessment at baseline. If elevation of CK is 4x ULN, do not start treatment. Routine monitoring is not necessary except when patients complain of myalgia. Elevation of CK during therapy to 10x ULN demands discontinuation of drug and bimonthly monitoring  of  CK  and  renal  function.  Asymptomatic  CK elevation  to  less  than  10x  ULN,  continue  treatment  and monitor CK bimonthly whereas in symptomatic elevation of CK to less than 10x ULN, discontinue treatment, monitor CK and restart at lower dose after CK is normalized. Panel agreed to these recommendations and suggested for cautious use of statins in cases of hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.11 37"

      "left": "SECTION  2 Lipids and Diet CONCLUSION Cardiovascular  disease  is  a  major  disease  burden  in  India and as it is observed more commonly in young population compared  to  western  population.  Dyslipidemia  is  perhaps the  most  important  risk  factor  for  CVD,  particularly  for premature  CVD.  LDL-C  is  the  primary  target;  but  TGs  and non-HDL-C can be considered for intervention in patients with  grossly  deranged  levels.  LDL-C  less  than  70  mg/dL  is target  for  all  ASCVD  cases  with  optional  reduction  to  less than 50 mg/dL in very high-risk cases. Optional lipid targets that  can  be  considered  in  India  include  HDL-C  less  than 40 mg/dL and TGs less than 150 mg/dL (<100 mg/dL in very high-risk cases). Statins are first-line drugs for dyslipidemia. Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin,  and  pitavastatin  are  commonly  used  in  India. Ezetimibe  should  be  second  agent  to  statin  to  achieve  the desired  lipid  targets.  Low-dose  statin  in  combination  with ezetimibe  may  be  considered  in  patients  with  significant statin  related  side  effects.  Addition  of  fenofibrate  should  be considered  to  statin  to  lower  TGs  less  than  200  mg/dL,  but with close follow-up for liver and kidney derangement. For treatment of FH, statin, and ezetimibe combination is the primary treatment in India until PCSK9 inhibitors become readily available for clinical use. In  diabetes  with  high  CV  risk,  LDL-C  goal  is  less  than 70 mg/dL. Combination of modest dose statin with ezetimibe should be considered to control dyslipidemia in diabetes. In acute coronary syndrome and in patients undergoing PCI, LDL-C goal is less than 70 mg/dL with optional lowering to  less  than  50  mg/dL  in  very  high-risk  cases.  High-dose statin with addition of ezetimibe, if necessary, is suggested to achieve these lipid targets. In  nondialysis  dependent  CKD,  statin  ±  ezetimibe  is advised to achieve LDL-C goal of less than 70 mg/dL, eGFR should  guide  the  dosing  choice.  Use  of  high-dose  statin in  those  with  eGFR  less  than  30  mL/min/1.73  m2  requires consultation  with  nephrologist.  For  primary  and  secondary stroke  prevention,  high-dose  statins  are  advised.  Follow-up monitoring  is  advised  every  12  weeks  till  goals  are  reached and then annually. Liver function assessment at baseline and post-treatment  (after  4–6  weeks)  should  be  done.  CK  levels should be assessed in patients with myopathy or in those at high-risk of muscle damage.

The food that we eat can make us fat or thin” INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular  diseases  (CVDs),  especially  coronary  heart disease  (CHD),  are  epidemic  in  India.  The  World  Health Organization  (WHO)  and  Global  burden  of  disease  study also  have  highlighted  increasing  trends  in  years  of  life  lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from CHD in  India.  In  India,  studies  have  reported  increasing  CHD prevalence over the last 60 years, from 1% to 9–10% in urban populations and less than 1% to 4–6% in rural populations.1 This  increase  has  been  largely  attributed  to  rapid westerni zation.  Westernization  has  made  food  calorie  rich and  convenient  for  the  common  man,  but  because  of  the various  ethnic,  epigenetic  reasons,  and  the  high  prevalence of  sarcopenic  adiposity,  Indians  are  vulnerable  to  adverse effects of these dietary changes. The present article attempts to provide, evidenced based strategies for a cardioprotective diet in Indian context. PREVALENCE OF DISEASE—IS THERE UNDERESTIMATION OF ACTUAL PROBLEM? Coronary  heart  disease  is  a  major  cause  of  mortality  and morbidity  all  over  the  world.  While  the  prevalence  and mortality  due  to  CHD  is  declining  in  the  developed  nations there has been an alarming increase over the past two decades in  the  prevalence  of  CHD  and  cardiovascular  mortality  in India and other South Asian countries.1 India is in a phase where it is going through an epidemiologic  transition  whereby  the  burden  of  communicable diseases has declined slowly, but that of noncommunicable diseases  (NCD)  has  risen  rapidly,  thus  leading  to  a  dual burden. The  prevalence  of  ischemic  heart  disease  (IHD)  has increased sevenfold to about 14% by 2013. Similarly, it is more than  quadrupled  in  rural  areas,  from  1.7  to  7.4%  between 1970 and 2013.2",
      "right": "7CHAPTER The  Global  Burden  of  Disease  study  estimate  of  agestandardized CVD death rate of 272 per 100,000 population in India is higher than the global average of 235 per 100,000 population. Some aspects of the CVD epidemic in India are particular as its accelerated build up, the early age of disease onset in the population, and the high case fatality rate.2 The higher case fatality among Indians following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) could result in the underestimation of actual problem. DIET AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: EVIDENCE Global  disease  burden  of  CVD  is  increasing  across  the globe including  India,  which is  experiencing  a  rapid health  transition.  Diet  and  nutrition  have  been  extensively investigated as risk factors for major CVDs in various studies like  The  INTERHEART  study,  The  Lyon  Diet  Heart  Study, The  Framingham  and  offspring  Study;3  these  studies  are conducted  within  and  across  populations,  to  link  several nutrients, minerals, food groups, and dietary patterns with an increased or decreased risk of CVD.3-5 INDIAN DIET Diversity of Indian Diet—Is It (cid:54)(cid:88)(cid:73)(cid:191)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:92)(cid:34) India  has  a  rich  and  highly  varied  cuisine,  and  its  various diets  are  strongly  related  to  social  identity,  religion,  and other  cultural  factors,  as  well  as  local  agricultural  practices and availability of diverse foods. Indian food is paradoxically considered  strongly  vegetarian,  but  it  is  actually  lacking in  vegetable  content  rather,  is  centered  on  wheat,  in  the north,  and  rice,  in  the  south  with  daal  being  the  second most  important  element.  One  can  have  an  entire  South Indian  vegetarian  meal  without  encountering  even  a  single vegetable.  The  most  important  vegetable  that  is  consumed"

Whatever amount of greens is taken is deeply fried which kills its nutrient content.5 Westernization of Indian Diet The  prevalence  of  CVDs  increased  by  threefold  in  India as  compared  to  west  by  the  turn  of  20th  century6  which is  attributed  to  rapid  westernization.  Westernization  is correlated with increase in consumption of sugar, salt, high fat dairy products, eggs, red meat, and oils with their trans-fat content (Table 1). Various  methods  of  improving  the  taste  and  prolonging the shelf life of food substances like salting, refining, hydrogenation, and frying increases the energy density of the food materials.  The  harmful  components  of  the  westernized  diet are because of in its energy density and its ability to have a long shelf-life. CONTAMINATED VEGETARIANISM Vegetarianism  prevalent  in  India  is  aptly  criticized  as  the contaminated  vegetarianism,  consuming  large  amounts of  fried  foods,  excess  of  salt,  sugar,  and  ghee.  Hence,  the protective components in the vegetarian diet are considerably lacking in our diet. (cid:38)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:3) Since, cholesterol can be synthesized in the body, all recommendations  advice  to  restrict  dietary  cholesterol  consumption to be less than 300 mg/day, which is the average amount found in an ordinary egg yolk. In  typical  omnivorous  diets,  the  relationship  of  intake of  cholesterol  in  low  doses  and  blood  cholesterol  is  linear. At higher cholesterol intakes, the relationship is curvilinear; changes in dietary cholesterol have less of an effect on serum cholesterol. The  also  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  differs  from  one person  to  another,  largely  from  differences  in  the  baseline diet  as  well  as  genetically  determined  intestinal  cholesterol absorptive capacity (Table 2). OIL CONSUMPTION Oil is a cooking medium which makes food more palatable. The  water  content  of  food  gets  replaced  by  the  oil,  which makes the food energy dense (Fig. 1). 40",

The  invisible  fat  content  of  the  cereals  and  pulses contribute to 3–5% of their weight. The person who consumes at  least  one  nonvegetarian  dish  a  day  does  not  require additional oil in his diet. The invisible fat content of the Indian diet  almost  matches  the  daily  requirement  of  40–60  g/day. Therefore, only vegans and people involved in heavy manual labor requires up to one to two table-spoons of oil and that too  only  if  they  are  unable  to  consume  the  recommended daily need of 30 g of nuts.9 The beneficial effect of fish and marine products in Indian diet  is  marred  by  the  widespread  deep-frying  habit  which oxidizes the cholesterol and transforms lipid contents making them more atherogenic. (cid:48)(cid:92)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:71) Polyunsaturated  fats  contain  essential  fatty  acids  (FA),  but have a short shelf-life, and thermal instability. It is better to use them as spreads or as seasoning. Most of refined oils with high  polyunsaturated  fatty  acid  (PUFA)  can  degrade  easily at  high  temperatures  to  toxic  component  like  free-radicals, trans-fats  and  malondialdehyde  which  are  atherogenic, hence  oil  which  are  stable  at  high  temperature  like  ghee, coconut oil, unrefined oil with high smoke point like mustard oil should be preferred for frying. Widely  advertised  (cid:90)-6-polyunsaturated  (mainly  linoleic acid) cooking oils like sunflower oil, may not be heart friendly, since  the  prostaglandins  derived  from  such  oils  are  more thrombogenic  than  the  (cid:90)-3-polyunsaturated  oils  (mainly ALNA) like canola, soybean, and rapeseed oil, so in diet n-6 to  n-3  ratio  should  not  be  more  that  5–10:1.  There  is  also evidence, that if we keep n-6 FA intake lesser, n-3 FA can be converted into long chain n-3 FA like [2-ethylhexanoic acid (EHA) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)].15"

Solid fats (at room temperature), including coconut oil and palm oil, have deleterious effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  (ASCVD)  risk  factors.  Liquid  vegetable  oils  have beneficial  effects  on  lipids  and  lipoproteins.  As  noted,  they decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The  evidence  base  for  olive  oil  [monounsaturated fatty  acids  (MUFAs)  rich]  is  the  most  comprehensive,  with clear  evidence  for  a  benefit  in  ASCVD  risk  reduction.  As olive  oil  is  expensive  and  out  of  reach  for  most  of  Indian population other alternative with equal benefit is mustard oil (MUFA rich).

The sterol for the animal kingdom is cholesterol and the recognition of oxidized cholesterol as an atherogenic moiety made the fats and oils of animal origin unacceptable choice as a cooking medium (Table 3).

Unsaturated fatty acids (for example, vegetable oils and fatty",
      "right": "CHAPTER  7 Indian Diet and  Coronary Artery Disease fish) decreases the amount of LDL-C and triglycerides in the blood and raises HDL-C.16 A  recent  meta-analysis  of  observational  studies  suggest that saturated fat intake is not associated with CVD, ischemic stroke,  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  all-cause  mortality.  In particular, a diet high in stearic acid appears to lower levels of unhealthy LDL-C.17 Available  evidence  from  adequately  controlled  randomized  trials  suggest  replacing  SFA  with  mostly  n-6  PUFA is  unlikely  to  reduce  CHD  events,  CHD  mortality  or  total mortality.18 FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN INDIAN DIET—MORE PRODUCTIONS BUT LESS CONSUMPTION The  WHO  recommends  a  daily  intake  of  at  least  400  g  (or five daily servings with an average serving size of 80 grams) of  fruits  and  vegetables,  excluding  potatoes,  cassava, and  other  starchy  tubers  to  prevent  diet-related  chronic diseases  and  micronutrient  deficiencies.  But  according  to the  India’s  Phytonutrient  Report  (2016)  notes  that  Indians consume  quite  less  than  the  norms.19 Lifestyle  factors  such as long working hours and junk food consumption and other factors  like  high  costs,  lack  of  availability  of  the  product throughout the year were some of the reasons attributed to low consumption.

ANTIOXIDANTS—DO THEY HAVE ANY ROLE IN OUR DIET? Antioxidant  phytochemicals like  flavonoids  are  richly concentrated  in  blueberries,  strawberries,  raspberries,  red cabbage, red radishes, and eggplant (purple vegetables) and have potent anti-inflammatory properties. Multiple  subsequent randomized  controlled trials (RCTs)  of  antioxidant  supplements  reported  either  neutral or negative results, including the GISSI trial of vitamin E, the Physicians  Health  Study  of  beta-carotene,  and  the  National Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)—AARP  Diet  and  Health  study  of multi vitamin supplementation (Table 4). A  process  known  as  hormesis is  hypothesized  to explain  the  neutral  or  negative  effects  of  excess  antioxidant supplementation. Hormesis is a biphasic dose response to a stressor  (toxic  chemical,  thermal,  or  radiological)  in  which a substance is beneficial at low doses but harmful at higher doses.  Low  doses  of  oxidant  stressors  induce  endogenous antioxidant production that seems to be protective (Table 4).21 PROTEIN SOURCE—INDIAN FOOD/CUISINE IS HIGH IN CARBS, STARCH, AND FAT If  we  look  at  veg  high  proteins—paneer/cottage  cheese, milk,  nuts  are  expensive.  Second-grade  vegetarian  proteins are  dals/lentils,  green  leafy  vegetables  are  relatively  cheap. Nonvegetarian  proteins  are  eggs,  chicken,  fish  which  again are  expensive  (Table  5).  Common  Indian  can’t  afford  to consume  them  every  day.  So,  carbs—roti/bread  and  rice— 42 are consumed more to fill up your stomach.",

However, the process of juicing concentrates calories, which makes it much easier  to  ingest  excessive  energy.

The RDA of milk for Indian vegetarians is 300 g/day as compared to 200 g/day for  nonvegetarians.  In  addition  to  milk,  80  g  of  meat,  eggs or  fish  will  provide  rest  of  necessary  vitamin  B12.  Although this  recommended  level  of  milk  in  lacto-vegetarians  intake",

Cow’s milk is a good source of vitamin B12, with 100 g of the  milk  containing  0.5–1.0  μg  of  vitamin  B12.  One  glass  of cow’s milk (250 g) provides 2.5 μg of vitamin B12, adequate to  meet  the  RDA  for  an  adult  man.  But,  it  has  been  shown that the dilution with water, storage or boiling (all of which are  common  household  practices)  may  reduce  vitamin  B12 to 2.1 μg (21% decrease).26 SUSCEPTIBILITY OF INDIANS (cid:54)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:37)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:86) Salt  and  sugar  are  easily  absorbed  and  get  distributed  in the total body water. Therefore, the amount consumed per drink/meal,  per  day  needs  to  be  matched  with  the  body water content. The usual content of sugar in Indian diet in often  high,  which  necessities  an  intense  insulin  response to  maintain  euglycemia.  Such  diet  which  is  high  in  sugar, when  consumed  by  children  may  not  have  any  immediate clinical manifestations, but led to early onset of dysglycemia in adult life.27 (cid:51)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:86) Postprandial  lipid  abnormalities  and  oxidant  stress  are pre ventable  components  of  dietary  modification.  Insulin response  of  food  depends  upon  route,  i.e.,  enteral  versus par  enteral  and  race.  Indians  have  more  intense  plasma insulin levels in response to an oral glucose load compared to Europeans.28 (cid:54)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92) Sarcopenic  adiposity  refers  to  the  situation  of  less  muscle mass and more adipose tissue for the same body mass index, which is a risk factor for the premature onset of cardiovascular risk  factors.  Smaller  body  volume  of  Indians  necessitates  a hyper  insulinemic  response  which  is  further  intensified  by the  insulin  resistance  caused  by  sarcopenic  adiposity.  This vicious cycle of intense hyperinsulinemia is a reason for the early onset of all the risk factors at a low body mass index in Indians noted in various studies (Flowchart 1).29 PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO REDUCE THIS EPIDEMIC (cid:120)(cid:3) Try to reduce intake of fried fast-food and processed foods (cid:120)(cid:3) Try to include variety of oils (extra virgin olive oil, canola, peanut,  unrefined  mustard  oil)  and  foods  containing natural fats (nuts, seeds, avocado, olives, soy, fish) in your diet.

Sonia Arora, Vitull K Gupta, Meghna Gupta INTRODUCTION During  the  past  decades,  the  world,  particularly  the  developing countries like India have witnessed rapid changes in diets  and  lifestyles.  General  improvement  in  the  standard of  living  has  been  accompanied  by  unhealthy  dietary patterns  and  insufficient  physical  activity  resulting  in increased  prevalence  of  lifestyle  and  diet-related  chronic diseases  worldwide.  WHO  states  that  by  2020  the  place  of the largest causes of death and disability will be occupied by cardiovascular  diseases  (CVDs)  and  prevalence  of  obesity, type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  and  hypertension  (HTN) which are considered to be chronic diseases related to the diet and lifestyle is also increasing. Diet  includes  foods  and  nutrients  which  provide  energy and  are  essential  for  normal  metabolism,  physiologic  and biochemical processes, growth and physical well-being. Diet essentially comprises of macronutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients like vitamins and minerals which  are  required  in  small  quantities.  Triglycerides  (TGs) are components of fat comprising of esters of alcohol glycerol and  fatty  acid  (FA)  chains.  Generally,  the  words  “lipids”, “oils”,  and  ”fats”  are  used  interchangeably.  Fats  that  are liquid  at  room  temperature  are  called  “oils”  and  generally have  unsaturated  or  short  FA  chains.  Word  “fats”  broadly means  solid  fats  at  room  temperature  and  word  “lipids” include  all  oils  and  fats  in  general.  Fat  supplies  more  than double the calories as compared to carbohydrate or protein making it an important dietary component with concentrated source of energy. Fat intake gives taste to diet, is metabolically important  constituent  of  the  body,  helps  absorption  of  fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and subcutaneous fat helps insulates the body. COMPOSITION OF FATS1 Fats  or  lipids  consist  of  FAs  which  are  of  two  types  as  discussed here.",
      "right": "8CHAPTER Saturated Fatty Acids Saturated  fatty  acids  (SFAs)  are  saturated  with  hydrogen atoms as carbon atoms have no double bonds in the fatty acid chain  comprising  of  lauric  acid,  palmitic  acid,  and  stearic acid  which  provide  stability  to  saturated  fats  (SFs)  and  are usually  solid  at  room  temperature  because  single  bonds between  the  carbon  atoms  are  more  stable  than  double bonds.  Fat  intake  increases  total  cholesterol  (TC)  and  lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol which is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), certain cancer and also impairs insulin sensitivity. SFAs are present in milk products  (cream,  ghee,  butter,  khoya,  and  paneer),  animal tallow,  palm  oil,  coconut  products,  and  oil,  etc.  Results  of ecological  studies  investigating  the  relation  of  coronary heart  disease  (CHD)  to  dietary  intake  of  SFs  suggested  that development of CHD was related to higher intake of total fat content  and  SFs.  In  a  study,  it  was  seen  that  percentage  of calories intake comprising of SFs was correlated strongly with coronary death rates in several defined populations in seven countries.2 Moreover  correlation  between  the  CHD  incidences  was weaker when compared to percentage of calories from total fat.  Analysis  of  follow-up  data  from  Nurses’  Health  Study showed  that  a  5%  of  calories  from  SF  were  associated  with 17% more risk of CHD as compared to ingestion of equivalent percentage  of  calories  from  carbohydrates.  Dietary  intake of  short-  and  medium-chain  SFAs  was  shown  to  have insignificant CHD risk where as small CHD risk was observed with  intakes  of  longer-chain  SFAs.3  Different  SFAs  have different  effects  on  plasma  lipid  and  lipoprotein  levels  that increase total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were observed with SFAs containing 12–16 carbon atoms.4 Unsaturated Fatty Acids Unsaturated  fatty  acids  (USFAs)  comprise  of  monounsaturated  fatty  acids  (MUFA)  and  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids (PUFA). MUFA contain one double bonds and PUFA contain more than one double bonds within the fatty acid chain."

    "page_40": {
      "left": "Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Lipid  peroxidation  occurs  to  a  lesser  degree  in  MUFA  as compared to PUFA as MUFA contain one double bond only, e.g.,  oleic  acid,  erucic  acid.  Studies  have  shown  decrease in  total  mortality  and  CHD  deaths  with  increased  intake of  MUFA.5  It  is  suggested  that  MUFAs  are  useful  because  it helps  decrease  free  cholesterol  by  promoting  cholesterol esterification  in liver,  promote  receptor-mediated  LDL uptake,  lower  LDL,  and  increase  high-density  lipoprotein (HDL). Recent evidence stresses on exploring the role of SFA, PUFA,  and  MUFA  ratio  in  diet  and  intake  of  individual  fat components as they influence LDL/HDL ratio and lipoprotein metabolism.  Dietary  sources  of  MUFA  include  almonds, peanuts, fruits like olives and avocados, olive oil, rice bran oil (RBO), groundnut oil, canola oil, and mustard oil. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  have  a  carbon–carbon  double bond  in  a  final  N-6  position  and  are  prone  to  lipid  peroxidation  because  it  has  greater  number  of  double  bonds. Examples  are  linoleic  acid,  linolenic  acid,  arachidonic  acid, eicosapentaenoic  acid  (EPA),  and  docosahexaenoic  acid (DHA).  Dietary  sources  include  invisible  fats  present  in pulses  and  cereals,  sunflower  oil  has  50%  PUFAs,  corn  oil 60%, cottonseed 50%, and safflower oil contain 70% PUFAs. Results of another study suggested a substantial reduction in  CHD  risk  when  trans  fat  (TF)  were  replaced  by  polyunsaturated fat in the diet or other foods high in trans fatty acids (TFAs).6 Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Omega-3 [(cid:68)-linolenic acid (ALA), N-3] and omega-6 (linoleic acid) fatty acids are unsaturated “essential fatty acids” (EFAs) because human metabolism cannot create them. Omega-6 Fatty Acids (Linoleic Acid, N-6) At N-6 position there is double bond between carbon–carbon atoms and more number of double bonds make omega-6 fatty acids more prone to lipid per oxidation. Omega-6 fatty acids (N-6)  are  also  important  for  health.  PUFA  intake  decreases LDL  and  increases  insulin  sensitivity.  A  study  concluded that  a  significantly  lower  incidence  of  type  2  diabetes mellitus  (T2DM)  was  associated  with  higher  intake  of  N-6 and  substantial  reduction  of  CHD  risk  was  observed  when long chain SFs was replaced by polyunsaturated fat.7 But the beneficial effect of N-3 is reduced by intake of more quantity of  N-6.  Dietary  sources  include  invisible  fat  in  cereals  and pulses, margarine, safflower oil corn oil, sunflower oil, kardi oil, etc. Omega-3 Fatty Acids(Alpha-Linolenic Acid, N-3) N-3  consists  of  double  bond  at  N-3  carbon  atom  and  is precursors  to  anti-inflammatory  products  in  the  body. Dietary  sources  include  legumes,  green  leafy  vegetables, citrus  fruits,  nuts,  and  fish,  especially  fatty  fish.  Mustard  oil has  6–11%  of  N-3,  canola/rapeseed  7%,  hemp  oil  20%,  flax (linseed) oil has 55%, the richest plant-based source. Hemp",
      "right": "CHAPTER  8 Edible Oils: What is Right and What is Wrong? and  flax  oils  are  not  commonly  used  as  table  or  cooking oil.  Most  of  the  N-3  available  from  plant  sources  is  in  form of  ALA.  Decrease  platelet  aggregation  and  formation  of proaggregatory thromboxane A was observed when dietary 2 consumption  of  ALA  was  increased.8  Several  epidemiologic studies  showed  that  increase  in  linolenic  acid  intake  was associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of  CHD  mortality9,10 but  in these studies other dietary factors like dietary vitamins, other fats,  vegetables,  and  folate  were  not  adequately  adjusted. Based  on  strong  data  to  support  favorable  effect  of  N-3  on prevention of CVD, it was suggested that diet rich in N-3 can be beneficial.11 Evidence suggested that the protective effects of  fish  oil  based  N-3  may  involve  multiple  mechanisms, like  decreasing  TG  levels,  reducing  platelet  aggregation, antiarrhythmic effects, improving endothelial dysfunction so decreasing atherosclerosis as well as improving endothelialdependent vasomotor function.12 Omega 6 (N-6) to Omega 3 (N-3) Ratio Balanced ratio of N-6 and N-3 is important for efficient body functions.  N-6  and  N-3  are  converted  into  biological  active components by competing for the common enzymes so when one  component  is  consumed  more  than  the  other,  it  leads to  imbalance  in  the  metabolism  of  N-6  and  N-3  gradually affecting  several  metabolic  processes.  Recommendations suggest that level of adequate intake of N-6 and N-3 depends on  several  factors  like  age,  gender,  and  life  style,  etc.  and several  organizations  have  recommended  different  ratios like N-6:N-3 of 4:1 (Institute of Medicine) 5:4 (World Health Organization)  and  several  suggest  that  ratio  near  1:1  may be  considered  as  optimal  ratio.13  Several  foods  are  good sources of both N-6 and N-3 and ratio may be different like N-6:N-3  ratio  is  4:1  in  walnuts,  1689:1  in  almonds.  In  green leafy vegetables the ratio is less than 1, so to improve the ratio several food combinations are suggested to get the ratio of at least 10 to 1. The best N-6:N-3 ratio was found in mustard oil (1.2:1) and canola oil (2.2:1) and adverse ratio was found in olive oil (12.84), corn oil (46.01), and peanut butter (225.63). TRANS FATTY ACIDS OR PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED FATTY ACIDS Incomplete  hydrogenation  of  vegetable  oils  results  in  formation  of  TFs  and  complete  hydrogenation  results  in formation  of  SFs.  TFs  may  confer  texture  to  food  and structural stability. Lamb and beef contain small quantity of natural TFAs. A review suggested that even low consumption of 1–3% of total calorie intake of TFs leads to increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and TFs are more dangerous to  CV  health  than  any  other  macronutrient  even  on  a  percalorie basis.14 Increased intake of TFs can increase the risk of CVD because it can lead to increase in LDL, TGs, lipoprotein (a)  and  decrease  in  HDL  adversely  affecting  metabolism  of EFA  and  prostaglandins  promoting  thrombogenesis  and insulin  resistance.12 In  a  land  mark  study,  it  was  found  that the  risk  of  CAD  nearly  doubled  with  2%  increase  in  intake 47 of TF calories and to produce similar risk of CAD about 15%"

It was found that risk of CHD decreased by more than half (53%) by replacing 2% of  food  energy  from  TFAs  with  nontrans  unsaturated  fats.3 Sources of TFs include dalda and vanaspati ghee, margarines, baked  foods,  readymade  mithais  and  processed  foods,  and ready to eat snacks. CHOLESTEROL Cholesterol, an essential component of animal life, is found in  animal  fats  including  dairy  products  and  nonvegetarian foods. Chemically cholesterol is a waxy sterol of fat. Very small amount of cholesterol is present in plants so generally plant oils  are  devoid  of  cholesterol.  It  is  thought  that  absorption of  cholesterol  from  intestine  is  decreased  by  phytosterols, a  plant  product  because  both  phytosterols  and  cholesterol compete  with  each  other  for  absorption  in  intestine.  It  is recommended to restrict the cholesterol consumption to less than 200 mg by decreasing animal fat consumption. Adverse effects of increased consumption of cholesterol are because it increases TC and LDL15 but the adverse effects are relatively less  as  compared  to  increased  consumption  of  SFAs  and TFAs16  and  different  individuals  responded  very  differently to  the  effects  of  dietary  fats.17  Cholesterol  broadly  is  of  two types, LDL and HDL. LDL is considered as “bad cholesterol” responsible  for  atherosclerosis  and  CAD  where  as  HDL  is “good  cholesterol”  help  prevent  and  retard  progression  of atherosclerosis. Ghani Ghani  is  a  traditional  method  of  oil  processing  in  India  in which oilseeds and subsequently the expressed oil are held in a scooped circular pit in the exact centre of a circular mortar made of stone or wood with a stout, upright pestle descending from  a  top  curved  or  angled  piece,  permitting  the  pestle to  rotate  as  the  animal  moves  in  a  circular  ambit,  exerting lateral pressure on the upper chest of the pit, first pulverizing the oilseed and then crushing out its oil. There are regional variations in ghani design in India like large granite ghanis of Southern India (capacity 35–40 kg), wooden ghani of Western India (capacity 8–15 kg), Bengal ghani (capacity 5–10 kg), and Punjab  ghanis  (small  capacity  with  a  short  pestle).  Sesame, rapeseed,  mustard,  coconut,  groundnut,  and  safflower  oils were produced from mild ghani crushing and oils produced are known as “Kachi Ghani ka Tel”. Cold Pressed Oils Cold  pressed  oils  are  called  when  ancient  methods  of hydraulic press is used to produce oils and oils such produced are in natural state retaining natural odor, taste, color, flavor, and nutrition. This process avoids exposing the oil to chemical solvents or high temperatures during extraction. (cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:191)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:86) Refined  oil  are  produced  using  mechanical  and  chemical extraction  methods  from  seeds  and  vegetable  products  and 48",
      "right": "these methods affect taste, destroy antioxidants, generate free radicals and are more susceptible to turn rancid but refined oils are relatively pure. (cid:56)(cid:81)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:191)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:86) Oils  which  are  extracted  from  seeds  or  other  vegetable material by exerting continuous pressure at high temperature of 200–250 °C are called unrefined oils and these are different from  “cold  pressed”  oils  called  “expeller  pressed”  oils.  Unrefined oils retain antioxidants, other nutrients, and flavor; so these oils are considered better and recommended for use. Rancidity Rancidity  is  the  term  used  for  development  of  unpleasant odor or flavor in fats and oils. Rancidity is classified according to the method of its production like hydrolytic, oxidative, and ketonic. Smoke Point or Flash Point Smoke  point  is  the  temperature  at  which  decomposition and nutritional degradation of fats or oils occur resulting in formation of glycerol, free fatty acids (FFA), and bluish smoke giving  an  unpleasant  and  disagreeable  flavor  to  the  food. So, it is an important factor while selecting the oils required for heating that is use oils with higher smoke point for deep frying. Different oils have different smoke points depending on the origin and refinement of oils. Flash  point  is  the  temperature  much  higher  than  the smoke  point  at  which  the  vapors  from  oil  can  ignite  when mixed with air. Dietary fat studies showed that when heated PUFA containing oils like soya, canola, sunflower, and corn oil degrade easily to toxic compounds. WHAT ARE EDIBLE OILS? Fatty acids triesters with glycerol which are in liquid form at room temperature are the class of lipids known as oils and are  generally  found  in  both  plants  and  animals.  TGs  that are  solid  or  semisolid  at  room  temperature  are  classified as  fats  and  occur  predominantly  in  animals.  Any  material which has an oily or greasy feel and cannot be mixed with water is called “oil”. Edible oils include oils used for cooking which involves heat as well as used in food preparation and flavoring  not  involving  heat,  such  as  salad  dressings  and bread dips. WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG OIL? Out  of  numerous  available  oils,  which  oil  is  the  right  oil  or the  wrong  oil  to  use  depends  on  the  purpose  of  their  use like  cooking,  deep  frying,  shelf-life  of  oil  or  other  specific qualities or flavor determine the preference for use of that oil. More  important  is  the  health  benefits  which  depend  on  fat composition  of  various  oils,  ratio  between  SFA,  MUFA,  and PUFA."

Evidence suggests  that  mustard  oil,  which  was  previously  thought to  be  harmful  because  of  high  erucic  acid  content,  is  now considered as one of the best as it has near ideal N-6:N-3 ratio of  6:5  and  contains  low  SFAs  and  high  MUFAs  and  PUFAs along  with  high  amount  of  antioxidants.  “Kachi  Ghani” or  cold-pressed  mustard  oil  retains  the  natural  properties and  nutritional  values  of  mustard.  Studies  indicate  a  dosedependent benefit of intake of vegetables or use of mustard oil on ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk. The risk was lower with the use of mustard oil for frying as compared to the use of sunflower oil and risk decreased by about 70% when cooking medium was mustard oil.19,20 Rapeseed Oil (Canola Oil) It is produced from plant belonging to Brassica family which is related to mustard plant and is known as “canola oil” after the term “Canadian oil”. It has high MUFA and low SFA (<7%) contents with favorable N-3 levels and considered health oil by various associations and organizations.21 Olive Oil As  the  name  indicates  olive  oil  is  extracted  from  olives and  considered  to  be  the  best  oil  as  it  has  75%  MUFA  and numerous useful antioxidants (hydroxytyrosol). High levels of  MUFA  and  antioxidants  (oleuropein  or  tyrosol)  are present in extra virgin or virgin olive oil which is produced by  minimum  processing  and  intake  of  MUFA  is  known to  decrease  LDL  and  increase  HDL,  exerts  anti-inflammatory,  anti thrombotic,  antihypertensive  and  vasodilatory effect  which  may  decrease  CAD  risk.13,22  Epidemiological evidence suggests that antioxidants (oleuropein or tyrosol) have  beneficial  effect  against  some  cancers,  increases arterial elasticity, and decreases risk of stroke and IHD.23 Big disadvantage is its unfavorable N-6:N-3 ratio. Soyabean Oil This  oil  is  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  cooking  oils which  is  rich  in  USFAs  (51%  linoleic  acid,  23%  oleic  acid, and  7–10%  (cid:68)-linolenic  acid)  and  10%  palmitic  acid  and 4%  stearic  acid  (SFAs).  Soyabean  oil  should  be  used  fresh because it tends to turn rancid earlier. It is suggested that to achieve the combination of high PUFA and MUFA contents by combining the oils rich in MUFA or PUFA like olive oil, mustard  oil  or  groundnut  oil  to  achieve  optimum  health benefits.",

Rice Bran Oil It is produced from rice husk and germ and contain 47% MUFA, 33%  PUFA,  and  20%  SFA  making  it  oil  with  most  favorable constituents  rich  in  phytosterols,  (cid:74)-oryzanol,  and  vitamin  E. Vitamin E and (cid:74)-oryzanol are powerful anti oxidant and help in prevention of IHD.24 Phytosterols helps to decrease absorption of  cholesterol  absorption  imparting  health  benefits.  Its  mild flavor and high smoke point (254oC) makes it useful for deep frying. Only disadvantage is unfavorable N-6:N-3 ratio of 23:1.

Sunflower oil has high levels  of  N-6  and  unfavorable  N-6:N-3  ratio  of  120:1.  More over evidence of health benefits of high N-6 intake is limited. Cottonseed Oil It is economical, stable for frying, has long shelf-life because of  natural  rancid-free  property  and  contains  18%  MUFA, 52% PUFA with naturally occurring SFAs (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) thereby called as “naturally hydrogenated” oil. Its very high SFA and very low MUFA contents make its health benefits  controversial.25  Moreover  because  of  excessive use  of  agrichemicals,  cottonseeds  and  so  cottonseed  oil tends  to  contain  high  levels  of  pesticides,  which  may  cause adverse health effects.

Coconut  oil  is  primary  oil  used  by  tropical  people and  its  SFAs  consist  of  lauric  acid  which  differs  from  SFAs of  animal  origin.  SFAs  in  coconut  oil  mostly  consist  of  the medium chain TGs and may not impart same risks as other SFAs.26 Lauric acid is responsible for increasing HDL levels and thereby increases TC. Sesame Oil (“Til ka Tel”) Sesame  oil  is  a  vegetable  oil  extracted  from  the  seeds  of sesame plant, one of the oldest plants used for the extraction of oil. In developing countries like India, less expensive and manual methods like hot water flotation, bridge presses, ram presses,  the  ghani  process  or  small-scale  expeller  are  used to extract oils whereas in advanced countries expeller press, larger-scale oil extraction machines, or by pressing followed by  chemical  solvent  extraction  are  used.  Cold  pressing  is popular method because it avoids chemical solvents or high temperature  exposure  during  oil  extraction  and  traditional methods like ghani help retain the pleasant taste, nutrients, and flavor. It is used as edible oil and for various other health benefits  like  skin  care,  hair  care,  anti-aging  characteristics, alternative  medicine,  traditional  massages,  etc.  Sesame  oil is  composed  of  almost  equal  amount  of  MUFAs  (39%  oleic acid) and PUFAs (41% linoleic acid) with remaining amount composed of SF (8% palmitic acid and 5% stearic acid). It is rich in vitamin K. It has high smoke points and it is least prone to turn rancid due to presence of natural antioxidants, such as sesamol. Sesame oil is most popular in states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Linseed or Flaxseed Oil (Alsi ka Tel) Linseed  oil  is  an  edible  oil  which  is  colorless  to  yellowish obtained  by  pressing  or  sometimes  followed  by  solvent extraction  from  the  dried,  ripened  seeds  of  the  flax  plant (Linum  usitatissimum).  Raw  cold-pressed  linseed  oil  is easily  oxidized  and  rapidly  becomes  rancid  generating  an unpleasant odor, unless refrigerated, has a short shelf-life of only a few weeks making it less desirable for use as cooking oil.  It  is  composed  of  9–10%  of  SFAs  (6%  palmitic  and  4% stearic), about 20% MUFAs (mainly 20% oleic acid), and more than 70% PUFAs (70% (cid:68)-linolenic fatty acid). Several studies suggested  that  primary  benefit  of  flaxseed  oil  is  because  of ALA  and  it  exerts  dose-dependent  effects  on  inflammatory 50 mediators and markers.27",
      "right": "Numerous  studies  analyzing  epidemiological  investigations  and  experimental  data  have  shown  the  ability  of increased  omega-3  fatty  acid  intake  to  help  regulate  and reduce  blood  pressure  in  hypertension  and  diet  low  in  SFs and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from flaxseed  has  been  demonstrated  to  combat  CVD.28  Healthy properties  are  related  to  anti-inflammatory,  antioxidant, anticarcinogenic activities and to the lowering of cholesterol, the decrease of CVD and the prevention of diabetes. Linseed oil is a drying oil that is, it can polymerize into a solid form, due to which it is used with combinations of other oils, resins or  solvents  as  an  impregnator,  drying  oil  finish  or  varnish in  wood  finishing,  as  a  pigment  binder  in  oil  paints,  as  a plasticizer and hardener in putty and in the manufacture of linoleum. Butter Butter is from animal source with high contents of cholesterol  and  SFAs.  Butter  can  increase  total,  LDL  and  HDL cholesterol  and  its  low  smoke  point  makes  is  unfavorable for deep frying. Ghee Ghee is made by clarifying butter which has high smoke point making it favorable for frying. Vanaspati Ghee Vanaspati ghee is made by hydrogenation of refined vegetable oil. Hydrogenation increases TFAs, makes it less likely to turn rancid, more stable, increases shelf-life, but it does not contain bioactive  compounds,  natural  vitamins  or  antioxidants  and because of low smoke point it is not favored for deep frying. It  is  considered  to  be  responsible  for  development  of  IHD because of its adverse lipid profile. CHOOSING THE RIGHT OIL Properties  of  cooking  oil  like  fatty  acid  contents,  micronutrients, shelf-life, smoke point, etc. are helpful in selection of right cooking oil. Among the available cooking oils, none of it fulfills the recommended profile because if oil has high MUFA  which  is  desirable,  it  may  not  have  desired  N-6:N-3 ratio  or  appropriate  ratio  of  MUFA,  PUFA,  or  SFAs.  So,  it  is recommended  to  rotate  or  blend  the  oils  like  mustard  oil, groundnut  oil,  canola  oil,  RBO,  etc.  to  achieve  the  desired lipid contents. WHY ROTATION OR BLENDING IS NEEDED? Evidence  suggests  that  CV  health  is  greatly  influenced  by dietary fat profile and type of fat affects the lipid profile of the individual increasing or decreasing the CVD risk. TC and LDL cholesterol are increased with increased intake of SFs. Intake of PUFA greatly reduces the CVD risk as compared to MUFA.2 Intake  of  TFAs  formed  during  partial  hydrogenation  of  fat,"

N-6 predominantly  lowers  LDL  cholesterol  and  N-3  lowers TGs.  N-3  is  cardioprotective  through  various  mechanisms like  vasodilation,  antiarrhythmic  effect,  anti-inflammatory effects,  improves  endothelial  function,  decreased  platelet aggregation  and  reduces  collagen  deposition.30  That  is  why it  is  important  to  have  optimum  composition  of  these  fats to  achieve  health  and  cardio protective  effects.  Numerous health and dietary bodies have issued guidelines suggesting various  recommendations  regarding fatty  acid intake. Guidelines  for  prevention  of  CVD  have  suggested  8–10% SFAs  of  total  calories,  5–8%  PUFAs,  and  rest  of  the  total calories are constituted by MUFA with ratio of PUFA:SFA to be about 0.8:1 and for PUFA comprising of both omega-6 and omega-3  in  ratio  5:10.4  Favorable  ratio  of  SFA:MUFA:PUFA comes out to be 1:1.5:1 if maximum amount of total fat intake is  taken  into  consideration.31  American  Heart  Association (AHA)  cardioprotective  recom mendations  include  intake  of less than7% of saturated fat, less than 1% TF of total calorie consumption and less than 300 mg cholesterol per day. AHA suggests an important role of oils and fats in total dietary fat intake.32  Evidence  suggests  that  different  lipid  components have  different  favorable  and  adverse  health  effects.  Even blending  two  cooking  oils  cannot  fulfill  the  recommended ratio  of  different  lipid  components  for  favorable  health  and CVD effects, necessitating the need to blend more than two cooking  oils  to  achieve  desired  lipid  contents  for  health benefits. CONCLUSION In this present era of consumerism,  people are  exposed  to different type of edible oils glorified with tall health claims and benefits, advertizing various cooking oils with attractive slogans,  highlighting  presence  or  absence  of  different lipid  contents  to  influence  people’s  choice  of  cooking  oils. This  chapter  discusses  various  lipid  contents,  their  harms and  health  benefits,  desired  composition  of  different  lipid contents and composition of different edible or cooking oils in  an  attempt  to  demystifying  the  fancy  statements  for  all the people. Out of the discussed edible oils, none of the oils fulfill  the  recommended  criteria  of  lipid  contents  but  two oils  rapeseed  and  mustard  oil  which  have  high  PUFA  and MUFA,  low  SFA  content  and  highest  N-3:N-6  ratio  seems to  be  imparting  most  health  and  CVD  benefits.  Evidence suggests use of ghee and butter as a cooking oil should be limited and use of reheated fats and oils should be avoided. Since  none  of  the  available  cooking  oils  fulfill  the  criteria of  various  lipid  contents,  it  is  desirable  to  blend  or  rotate different cooking oils like mustard oil, groundnut oil, canola oil, and RBO with favorable lipid contents and limit the use of visible fat content for achieving desired favorable CV and overall health benefits.",

Among  above  mentioned  risk factors  dyslipidemia  is  common  in  diabetes.  It  consists  of low  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL),  increased  triglycerides (TGs),  and  postprandial  lipemia.  Even  if  lipid  profile  is within  normal  range  in  diabetics  functionally  abnormal lipids  like  small  dense  low  density  lipoprotein  (sdLDL)  and dysfunctional HDL are not uncommon. It  is  well-known  fact  now  that  besides  glucose  control global  risk  factors  modifications  like  cessation  of  smoking, adequate  blood  pressure  control,  and  cholesterol  lowering prevent  or  slow  progression  of  CVDs  in  diabetes.2  Since, dyslipidemia is a major contributor of this CV mortality and morbidity, its control is important target to be addressed. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES The  management  of  dyslipidemia  in  diabetes  essentially requires  the  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology  of  lipid derangement in diabetes. The  lipid  abnormalities  in  T2D  consists  of  high  TGs, decreased  HDL  cholesterol,  and  prese nce  of  sdLDL  cholesterol  and  it  leads  to  accelerated  athe rosclerosis.  In  T1D increased  TGs  are  common,  but  HDL  cholesterol  is  normal",
      "right": "9CHAPTER or  high  if  hyperglycemia  or  albuminuria  is  present.  In addition to above mentioned quantitative lipid abnor malities functional dysfunction of all lipoproteins is seen in diabetes. In  diabetes  because  of  insulin  deficiency  or  resistance abnormal function of various intermediary enzymes leads to hypertriglyceridemia, low or dysfunctional HDL, and sdLDL (Fig.  1).  Insulin  deficiency  or  resistance  activates  hormonal sensitive  lipase  in  centrally  distributed  adipose  tissues which  leads  to  increase  release  of  nonesterified  fatty  acids (NEFAs) from stored TGs. High level of NEFAs in circulation results  in  increased  uptake  by  liver  and  in  turn  hepatic  TG overproduction  and  increased  secretion  of  apolipoprotein B100. Both TG overproduction and increased apolipoprotein B100  secretion  result  in  increased  secretion  of  very-lowdensity  lipoprotein  (VLDL)  that  are  rich  in  TGs  and  further catabolism  of  VLDL  is  also  impaired  leading  to  increased VLDL concen tration in circulation.3 Decreased  activity  of  lipoprotein  lipase  located  on vascular endothelial cells in insulin deficiency or resistance contributes  to  postprandial  lipemia.  Circulating  LDL  can participate  in  cholesteryl  ester  transfer  protein  (CETP)mediated  exchange  of  its  cholesterol  esters  for  TGs  rich lipoproteins  viz.  chylomicrons  and  VLDL  which  generates TGs  rich  and  cholesterol  esters  depleted  LDL  particles  by lipoprotein  lipase  action,  produces  sdLDL  that  is  more atherogenic.4 The  process  of  reverse  cholesterol  transport  from  peripheral  tissues  is  important  function  of  HDL,  but  because of  CETP-mediated  exchange  of  core  lipids  is  increased  and HDL cholesterol is also TG rich. It further converts into small, dysfunctional HDL particles due to increased hepatic lipase activity in diabetes and it is no more protective. MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES In  lipid  management  of  diabetes,  an  important  tool of  treatment includes lifestyle intervention  and  drug"

Among  drugs,  statin  is  the  only  drug  recommended  in  diabetic  dyslipidemia.  Fibrates  and  niacin  are not  recommended  in  standard  guidelines.5-7  If  the  LDL cholesterol is still high (≥70 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin dose, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors can be added.

The patients of  more  than  or  equal  to  40  years  with  diabetes  are  usually on  guideline  directed  statin  therapy,  hence  the  lipid  profile estimation  should  be  done  before  starting  the  patient  on statin and 4–12 weeks after initiation or change of the dosing of the drug and yearly thereafter.

Emphasis  should  be  laid  on decreased intake of saturated fats, trans-fats, and cholesterol while encouraging the patients for increased intake of viscous fibers  (e.g.,  legumes,  citrus  fruits,  and  oats),  omega-3  fatty acids,  and  plant  sterols.

As  mentioned  in Tables 1 and 2), there are two statin dosing intensities that are to be used in clinical practice. It is known that the reduction with statin therapy in the coronary  heart  disease  deaths  and  nonfatal  myocardial infarction is maximum in patients with the highest number of risk factors but at the same time the statin therapy has overall benefit in patients with diabetes who are having a moderate or low-risk of CVD.13 The  diabetic  patients  are  risk  stratified  as  per  the presence  or  absence  of  documented  clinical  ASCVD  and are  respectively  advised  to  receive  secondary  or  primary prevention therapy. It is obvious that patients with clinical ASCVD are at higher risk and warrant high-intensity statin therapy  as  documented  in  multiple  large  randomized clinical studies.14"

In the era of more costly lipid lowering drugs it becomes all the more essential to target these therapies only to high CV risk patients and hence, there are many risk factors calculators available though none of them is perfect.15 The  commonly  used  American  College  of  Cardiology  or American Heart Association CVD risk calculator to estimate 10-year clinical ASCVD risk is incomplete because it does not accounts for duration of diabetes or presence of other complications like albuminuria.15 Primary Prevention Moderate-intensity  statin  is  recommended  for  primary  prevention in patients of more than or equal to 40 years of age.13,16 The  intensity  of  therapy  needs  to  be  escalated,  if  there  are",
      "right": "CHAPTER  9 Statins and Diabetes additional CV risk factors present. However, for the population more than 75 years, which has not been represented much in primary prevention trials, the recommendation is for at least moderate-intensity  statin  therapy  after  discussing  the  risk benefit with the patients.9,11,12 For patients less than 40 years of age the statin treatment approaches  remain  same  irrespective  of  type  1  or  type  2 diabetes, especially in the presence of CV risk factors.16 After discussing  the  risk  benefits  with  the  patient’s  moderateintensity  statin  therapy  is  recommended  for  patients  under the age of 40 years and/or who have T1D with other CV risk factors.17 (cid:54)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81) As  per  the  results  of  cholesterol  treatment  trialists’  collaboration  which  involved  26  statin  trials  comparing  high versus  moderate-intensity  statin,  high-intensity  statin treatment  is  recommended  for  all  patients  of  diabetes  with clinical  ASCVD  as  this  treatment  strategy  reduced  nonfatal CV event rates significantly.9 The  addition  of  nonstatin  LDL  lowering  agents  like ezitimibe18  and  PCSK9  inhibitors14  is  recommended  for patients with ASCVD who are already on maximally tolerated doses of statin therapy and LDL cholesterol is still more than 70  mg/dL.  Other  combination  therapies  like  statin/fibrates and statin/niacin have not been shown to provide additional CV benefit over statin alone5-7 and hence not recommended. NEW ONSET DIABETES WITH STATIN The  role  of  statins  is  clearly  established  for  primary  and secondary  prevention  in  reduction  of  further  CV  events  in all  high  risk  patients  including  diabetic  ones.  But  there  is  a small increase in risk of incident diabetes in patients whose blood  sugars  are  previously  normal  (over  5  years  of  followup, 1.2% of participants on placebo developed diabetes and 1.5%  on  rosuvastatin  developed  diabetes).19  The  CV  events rate reduction far outweighs the risk of incident diabetes with statin  use.  A  meta-analysis  of  13  randomized  statins  trials showed an odds ratio of 1.09 for new diagnosis of diabetes, so that treatment of 255 patients with statin for 4 years resulted in an additional one case of diabetes while at the same time, it prevented 5.4 CV events in these patients.19,20 CONCLUSION Diabetes  is  a  strong  risk  factor  for  CVD  outcome  and dyslipidemia further aggravates the risk, so its management in  diabetes  is  an  important  entity.  Lipid  profile  assessment is  essential  in  all  patients  of  diabetes  and  also  to  assess adherence,  response  to  therapy,  and  adverse  effects.  Highintensity statins are recommended at all ages in the presence of  clinical  ASCVD.  As  a  primary  prevention  in  patients  less than  40  years  and  more  than  75  years  of  age  statins  should be started after discussing risk benefits to the patients along with  assessment  of  CV  risk  factors.  Primary  prevention  is mandatory in patients between 40 years and 75 years of age 55 with intensity of statin depending on CV risk factors.21"

      "left": "Statin Intolerance: Guide to Management Mrinal K Das INTRODUCTION In  spite  of  the  highly  established  beneficial  effects  of reduction  of low-density lipoprotein  (LDL)-cholesterol in  atherosclerotic  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD),1,2  the application of lipid-lowering therapy has become a challenging issue because of the increased internet-based awareness and  concerns  of  the  patients  over  probable  side  effects  and potential  toxicity  of  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG coenzyme) reductase inhibitors, otherwise known as statins.  This  can  result  in  poor  adherence  to  statin  therapy and  ultimately  discontinuation.3,4  It  is  very  important  for patients  with  high  and  very  high  cardiovascular  (CV)  risk, since  dis continuation  of  statins  for  4–6  weeks  may  cause instability  of  the  atheroma  plaque5  and  thereby  increasing the  risk  of  CV  adverse  events.6  Therefore,  there  is  a  clinical need to ascertain the correct interpretation of the symptoms and signs presented by the patients after the statin therapy as well as developing approaches and therapies for such events so  that  the  benefit  of  lipid-lowering  therapy  is  continued. The present article will attempt on these aspects of perceived adverse effects of statin therapy otherwise also called “Statin Intolerance”  (SI)  and  highlight  the  available  remedial measures in the light of present information and knowledge. DEFINITIONS OF STATIN INTOLERANCE The definition of statin intolerance has evoked great deal of interest amongst clinicians and thus generating debate7 over the years. The following are the various definitions given by different lipid organizations available till date. National Lipid Association (NLA) defined SI in late 2014, as an inability to tolerate at least two statins—one at the lowest starting  daily  dose  and  another  at  any  daily  dose—due  to either disturbing symptoms (real or perceived) or abnormal laboratory findings that are temporally associated with statin therapy. They are reversible after withholding statin.4",
      "right": "10 CHAPTER International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) definition added to the above text the subsidence of symptoms or changes in biomarkers or even significant improvement after either dose reduction or stopping the medicine. Symptoms or alteration in  biomarkers  are  however  not  attributable  to  drug–drug interactions  and  predisposed  conditions  which  have  the propensity to increase the risk of statin intolerance.8 European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) offered clinically oriented definition of SI by inserting the assessment of statinassociated  muscle  symptoms  (SAMS)  which  included  the characteristics of muscle symptoms, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and their temporal association with starting statin therapy, and suspension of the therapy and rechallenge.9 Canadian  Consensus  Working  Group  update, in 2016,  defined  SI  as  a  clinical  syndrome,  not  induced  by drug  inter actions  or  risk  factors  for  untreated  intolerance and  manifested  by  significant  adverse  symptoms  and/ or  abnormal  biomarker  level  that  prevent  the  long-term treatment and adherence. These need to be documented by challenge  (starting  the  medicine)/dechallenge  (reduction of  the  dosage  of  medicine)/rechallenge  (restarting  the same  medicine),  as  per  the  appropriateness,  using  at  least two  statins,  including  the  commonly  used  atorvastatin  and rosuvastatin. There should also be the documentation of the failure of maintenance of therapeutic goals, as recommended by the national guidelines.10 TYPES OF STATIN INTOLERANCE Partial There is inability to tolerate a suitable dose of a statin based on patient’s CV risk as in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) there is intolerance of either atorvastatin at a dose of 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin  at  20–40  mg  dose.  It  can  appear  with  temporal associations  between  symptoms  and  treatment  onset  or increased dose usually within 3–6 months."
