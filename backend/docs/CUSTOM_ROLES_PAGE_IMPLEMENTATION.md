# Custom Roles Page Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a fully functional Custom Role Management page for the Hospital Admin portal that displays custom roles, shows statistics, and allows management of users within each role.

## Backend Changes

### New Endpoint: Get Users by Role
**File:** `backend/routes/hospital_admin_routers.py`

**Endpoint:** `GET /hospital-admin/hospitals/{hospital_id}/roles/{role_name}/users`

**Purpose:** Fetches all users who have a specific role within a hospital.

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "user_id": 23,
    "username": "kasturi",
    "email": "kasturi@gmail.com",
    "first_name": "kshitij",
    "last_name": "kasturi",
    "role_name": "lmaoxd"
  }
]
```

**Implementation:**
- Queries `hospital_role` table to find the role
- Fetches active users from `hospital_user_roles` with that role
- Joins with `user_details` to get full name information
- Returns empty array if role doesn't exist

### Fixed: Get User Details Endpoint
**Issue:** `Users` model doesn't have `is_active` attribute
**Fix:** Removed `is_active` from the response in `/hospital-admin/users/{user_id}` endpoint

## Frontend Changes

### Complete Rewrite of Custom Roles Page
**File:** `frontend/src/app/Hospital/roles/page.js`

**Key Features:**

1. **Role Statistics Cards**
   - Displays all custom roles in colored cards
   - Shows user count for each role
   - Color-coded by role (blue, purple, green, orange)

2. **Role Selector Dropdown**
   - Clean dropdown to select which role to view
   - Auto-selects first role on page load
   - Updates user table dynamically

3. **Users Table**
   - Shows all users with the selected role
   - Displays user avatar, name, email, and user ID
   - Includes Edit and Deactivate actions
   - Edit redirects to `/Hospital/editUser?userId={id}`
   - Deactivate performs soft delete

4. **Empty State**
   - Shows when no custom roles exist
   - Encourages creation of first custom role
   - Link to "Create Custom Role" page

5. **Loading States**
   - Initial loading spinner
   - Loading indicator while fetching users

## Data Flow

```
1. Page loads
   ↓
2. Fetch all roles: GET /hospitals/{hospital_id}/roles
   ↓
3. Filter out default roles (doctor, patient, hospital_admin)
   ↓
4. Display custom roles in stats cards
   ↓
5. Auto-select first role
   ↓
6. Fetch users for selected role: GET /hospital-admin/hospitals/{hospital_id}/roles/{role_name}/users
   ↓
7. Display users in table
```

## Key Improvements

### From Complex to Simple
- **Old:** Used complex `UserManagement` component with dynamic API function generation
- **New:** Direct, clean implementation with clear data flow

### Real-Time Backend Data
- **Old:** Hardcoded role mappings and API calls
- **New:** All data comes from backend endpoints

### Better UX
- **Stats Cards:** Visual overview of all custom roles
- **Dropdown:** Easy role switching
- **Clear Actions:** Edit and deactivate buttons
- **Empty States:** Helpful guidance when no roles exist

## Backend Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /hospitals/{hospital_id}/roles` | Fetch all roles for hospital |
| `GET /hospital-admin/hospitals/{hospital_id}/roles/{role_name}/users` | Fetch users with specific role |
| `PUT /hospital-admin/hospitals/{hospital_id}/users/{user_id}/deactivate` | Soft delete user |
| `GET /hospital-admin/users/{user_id}` | Get user details (for edit page) |

## Testing

### Test Custom Roles Display
1. Login as hospital admin
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/Hospital/roles
3. Should see all custom roles in stats cards
4. Should see dropdown with custom roles

### Test User Listing
1. Select a role from dropdown
2. Should see all users with that role
3. Should display user name, email, ID

### Test User Actions
1. Click Edit (pencil icon) on a user
2. Should navigate to edit page with user data loaded
3. Click Deactivate (trash icon) on a user
4. Should confirm and deactivate user

### Test Empty State
1. Create a new hospital with no custom roles
2. Navigate to /Hospital/roles
3. Should see "No Custom Roles Yet" message
4. Should see "Create Your First Role" button

## Security

- All endpoints require hospital admin authentication
- Super admin is also allowed (via `allow_super_admin=True`)
- Users can only see roles and users from their own hospital
- Soft delete preserves data integrity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Role Permissions View:** Show which permissions each role has
2. **Role Editing:** Allow editing role permissions from this page
3. **Role Deletion:** Add ability to delete roles (with checks for assigned users)
4. **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple users for bulk operations
5. **User Search/Filter:** Add search functionality for large user lists
6. **User Count Loading:** Load user counts for all roles in parallel for stats cards

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/routes/hospital_admin_routers.py` - Added new endpoint and fixed user details endpoint

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/app/Hospital/roles/page.js` - Complete rewrite with cleaner implementation

## Migration Notes

- Old page backed up as `page_old.js`
- New implementation is drop-in replacement
- No database migrations required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
